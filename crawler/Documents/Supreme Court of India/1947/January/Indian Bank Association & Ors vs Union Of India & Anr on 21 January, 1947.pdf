</pre>
<p id="p_1">K.S. Radhakrishnan, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.    This Writ Petition, under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article 32</a> of the  Constitution  of  India,
has been preferred by the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) along with Punjab
National Bank and another, seeking the following reliefs :-
</p>
<p id="p_3">a.    Laying down appropriate guidelines/directions to be followed  by  all
      Courts within the territory of India competent  to  try  a  complaint
      under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881  (the  Act)
      to follow and comply with the mandate of <a href="/doc/45362031/" id="a_3">Section 143</a> of the said  Act
      read with <a href="/doc/765548/" id="a_4">Sections 261</a>  to  <a href="/doc/392607/" id="a_5">265</a>  of  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  1973
      (<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>.) for summary trial  of  such  complaints  filed  or  pending
      before the said Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_4">b.    Issue a writ of mandamus for compliance with the guidelines  of  this
      Hon’ble Court indicating various steps to  be  followed  for  summary
      trial of complaints under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_7">Section 138</a> of the said Act and  report  to
      this Hon’ble Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">c.    Issue a  writ  of  mandamus,  directing  the  respondents,  to  adopt
      necessary policy and legislative changes to deal with cases  relating
      to dishonor of cheqeus so that the same  are  expeditiously  disposed
      off in accordance with the intent of the Act and the guidelines to be
      laid down by this Hon’ble Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.    The first petitioner, which is an Association  of  Persons  with  174
banks/financial institutions as its members, is a voluntary association  of
banks and functions as think tank for banks in the matters of  concern  for
the whole banking industry.  The Petitioners submit that the  issue  raised
in this case is of considerable national importance  owing  to  the  reason
that in the era of  globalization  and  rapid  technological  developments,
financial trust and commercial interest have to be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.    The Petitioners submit that the banking industry has been  put  to  a
considerable disadvantage due to  the  delay  in  disposing  of  the  cases
relating  to  <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_8">Negotiable  Instruments  Act</a>.   The  Petitioner  banks  being
custodian of public funds find it difficult to expeditiously  recover  huge
amount of public fund which are blocked in cases pending under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section  138</a>
of the Negotiable Instruments Act,  1881.    Petitioners  submit  that,  in
spite of the fact, Chapter  XIV  has  been  introduced  in  the  <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_10">Negotiable
Instruments Act</a> by <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_11">Section 4</a> of the Banking, Public Financial  Institutions
and <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_12">Negotiable Instruments Laws  (Amendment)  Act</a>,  1988,  to  enhance  the
acceptability of cheques in settlement of liability by  making  the  drawer
liable for penalties in case of bouncing of cheques due to insufficiency of
funds, the desired object of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_13">Amendment Act</a> has not achieved.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.    Legislature has noticed that the introduction of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_14">Sections 138</a> to  <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_15">142</a>
of the Act has not achieved desired result  for  dealing  with  dishonoured
cheques, hence, it inserted new <a href="/doc/45362031/" id="a_16">Sections  143</a>  to  <a href="/doc/177946336/" id="a_17">147</a>  in  the  <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_18">Negotiable
Instruments Act</a> vide Negotiable Instruments  (Amendment  and  <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_19">Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act</a>, 2002 for speedy disposal of cases relating to dishonour of
cheques through summary trial as well as making the  offence  compoundable.
But, no uniform practice is seen followed by the various Magistrate  Courts
in the country, as a result of which, the object and purpose for which  the
amendments were incorporated, have not been achieved.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.     Cheque,  though  acknowledged  as  a  bill  of  exchange  under  the
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_20">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> and readily accepted in lieu of payment of money
and is negotiable, the  fact  remains  that  the  cheque  as  a  negotiable
instrument  started  losing  its  credibility  by  not  being  honoured  on
presentation.  Chapter XVII was introduced, as already indicated, so as  to
enhance the acceptability of cheques in  settlement  of  liabilities.   The
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended  with  the  Bill  explaining  the
provisions of the new Chapter reads as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      “This clause [Clause (4) of the Bill] inserts a new  Chapter  XVII  in
      the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_21">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, 1881. The provisions contained in  the
      new Chapter provide that where any cheque drawn by a  person  for  the
      discharge of any liability is returned by  the  bank  unpaid  for  the
      reason of the insufficiency of the amount of  money  standing  to  the
      credit of the account on which the cheque was drawn or for the  reason
      that it exceeds the arrangements made by the drawer of the cheque with
      the bankers for that account, the  drawer  of  such  cheque  shall  be
      deemed to have committed an offence. In that case, the drawer, without
      prejudice to the other provisions of the said Act, shall be punishable
      with imprisonment for a term which may extend to  one  year,  or  with
      fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            The provisions have also been made that to constitute the  said
      offence:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (a) such cheque should have been presented to the bank within a period
      of six months of the date of its drawal or within the  period  of  its
      validity, whichever is earlier; and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (b) the payee or holder in due course of such cheque should have  made
      a demand for the payment of the said  amount  of  money  by  giving  a
      notice, in writing, to the drawer of the cheque within fifteen days of
      the receipt of the information by him  from  the  bank  regarding  the
      return of the cheque unpaid; and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (c) the drawer of such cheque should have failed to make  the  payment
      of the said amount of money to the payee or the holder in  due  course
      of the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           It has also been provided that it shall be presumed, unless  the
      contrary is proved, that the holder of such cheque received the cheque
      in the discharge of a liability. Defences which  may  or  may  not  be
      allowed in any prosecution for such offence have also been provided to
      make the provisions effective. Usual provision relating to offences by
      companies has also been included in the said new Chapter. In order  to
      ensure that genuine and honest bank customers are not harassed or  put
      to inconvenience, sufficient safeguards have also been provided in the
      proposed new Chapter. Such safeguards are:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (a) that no court shall take cognizance of such offence  except  on  a
      complaint, in writing, made by the payee or the holder in  due  course
      of the cheque;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (b) that such complaint is made within one month of the date on  which
      the cause of action arises; and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (c) that no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate  or  a
      Judicial Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class  shall
      try any such offence.”


</blockquote><p id="p_10">6.    The objectives of the proceedings of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_22">Section 138</a> of the Act are  that
the cheques should not be used by persons as a tool of dishonesty and  when
cheque is issued by a person,  it  must  be  honoured  and  if  it  is  not
honoured, the person is given an opportunity to pay the  cheque  amount  by
issuance of a notice and if he  still  does  not  pay,  he  must  face  the
criminal trial and consequences.  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_23">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, 1881, is given below for easy reference :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      “138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc.,  of  funds  in  the
      account. - Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained
      by him with a banker for payment of any amount  of  money  to  another
      person from out of that account for the  discharge,  in  whole  or  in
      part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank  unpaid,
      either because of the amount of money standing to the credit  of  that
      account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that  it  exceeds  the
      amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with
      that bank, such person shall be deemed to have  committed  an  offence
      and shall, without prejudice to any other provision of  this  Act,  be
      punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or
      with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or  with
      both:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period  of  six
      months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of  its
      validity, whichever is earlier;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      (b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as  the  case
      may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money  by
      giving a notice, in writing, to  the  drawer  of  the  cheque,  within
      fifteen days of the receipt  of  information  by  him  from  the  bank
      regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment  of  the  said
      amount of money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder  in
      due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of the  receipt  of  the
      said notice.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      Explanation.- For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  "debt  or  other
      liability" means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.”

Ltd., Secunderabad v. Indian Technologists  &amp;  Engineers  (Electronics)  (P)
Ltd. and Another (1996) 2 SCC 739, held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      “6.…..The object of bringing <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_24">Section 138</a> on statute appears to  be  to
      inculcate faith in the efficacy of banking operations and  credibility
      in transacting business  on  negotiable  instruments.   Despite  civil
      remedy, <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_25">Section 138</a> intended to prevent dishonesty on the part of  the
      drawer of negotiable instrument to draw a  cheque  without  sufficient
      funds in his account maintained by him in a book and induce the  payee
      or holder in due course to act upon it.  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_26">Section 138</a> draws presumption
      that one commits the offence if he issues the cheque  dishonestly.  It
      is seen that once the cueque has been drawn and issued  to  the  payee
      and the  payee  has  presented  the  cheque  and  thereafter,  if  any
      instructions are issued to the bank for non-payment and the cheque  is
      returned to  the  payee  with  such  an  endorsement,  it  amounts  to
      dishonour of cheque and it comes within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_27">Section 138</a>….”

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      “The object and the ingredients under the provisions,  in  particular,
      <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_30">Sections 138</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_31">139</a> of the Act cannot be ignored. Proper  and  smooth
      functioning of all business transactions, particularly, of cheques  as
      instruments, primarily depends upon the integrity and honesty  of  the
      parties. In our country, in a large number of commercial transactions,
      it was noted that the cheques were issued even merely as a device  not
      only to stall but even to defraud  the  creditors.  The  sanctity  and
      credibility of issuance of  cheques  in  commercial  transactions  was
      eroded to a large extent. Undoubtedly, dishonour of a  cheque  by  the
      bank causes incalculable loss, injury and inconvenience to  the  payee
      and the entire credibility of the  business  transactions  within  and
      outside the country suffers a serious setback. Parliament, in order to
      restore the credibility of cheques as  a  trustworthy  substitute  for
      cash payment enacted the aforesaid provisions. The remedy available in
      a civil court is  a  long-drawn  matter  and  an  unscrupulous  drawer
      normally takes various pleas  to  defeat  the  genuine  claim  of  the
      payee.”

deficient  in  dealing  with  the  dishonoured   cheques.    In   the   said

      penalties in case of dishonour of  cheques  due  to  insufficiency  of
      funds in the account of the drawer of  the  cheque.  These  provisions
      were incorporated with a view to  encourage  the  culture  of  use  of

      proved to be inadequate, the procedure prescribed for  the  Courts  to
      deal with such matters has been found to be cumbersome. The Courts are
      unable to dispose of such cases expeditiously in a time  bound  manner

</p><p id="p_16">11.   <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_53">Section 145</a> of the Act deals with the evidence on affidavit and  reads
as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">      “145. Evidence on affidavit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">      (1)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54">  the  Code</a>  of  Criminal
      Procedure, 1973, (2 of 1974.) the evidence of the complainant  may  be

</blockquote><p id="p_17">12.   The scope of <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_55">Section 145</a> came up for consideration before  this  Court
in Mandvi Cooperative Bank Limited v. Nimesh B. Thakore  (2010)  3  SCC  83,
and the same was explained in that judgment  stating  that  the  legislature
provided for the complainant to give his evidence on affidavit, but did  not
provide the same for the accused.  The  Court  held  that  even  though  the
legislature in their wisdom did not deem it proper  to  incorporate  a  word
“accused” with the word “complainant” in <a href="/doc/62859559/" id="a_56">Section 145(1)</a>, it  does  not  mean
that the Magistrate could not allow the complainant to give his evidence  on
affidavit, unless there was  just  and  reasonable  ground  to  refuse  such
permission.
</p>
<p id="p_18">13.   This Court while examining the scope of <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_57">Section 145</a>  in  Radhey  Shyam
Garg v. Naresh Kumar Gupta (2009) 13 SCC 201, held as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      “If an affidavit in terms of the provisions of <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_58">Section 145</a> of the  Act
      is to be considered to be an evidence, it is difficult  to  comprehend
      as to why the court will ask the deponent of  the  said  affidavit  to
      examine himself with regard to the contents thereof once  over  again.
      He may be cross-examined and upon completion of his evidence,  he  may
      be re-examined. Thus, the words “examine any person giving evidence on
      affidavit as to  the  facts  contained  therein,  in  the  event,  the
      deponent is summoned by the court  in  terms  of  sub-section  (2)  of
      <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_59">Section 145</a> of the Act”, in our opinion, would mean for the purpose of
      cross-examination. The provision seeks to attend a salutary purpose.”




</blockquote><p id="p_19">14.   Considerable time is usually spent for recording the statement of  the
complainant.  The question is  whether  the  Court  can  dispense  with  the
appearance of  the  complainant,  instead,  to  take  steps  to  accept  the
affidavit of the complainant and treat  the  same  as  examination-in-chief.
<a href="/doc/62859559/" id="a_60">Section 145(1)</a> gives complete freedom to the complainant either to give  his
evidence by way of affidavit or by way of oral evidence.  The Court  has  to
accept the same even if it is given by way of an affidavit.  Second part  of
<a href="/doc/62859559/" id="a_61">Section 145(1)</a> provides that the complainant’s statement on  affidavit  may,
subject to all just exceptions, be read in evidence in  any  inquiry,  trial
or other proceedings.  <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_62">Section 145</a> is a rule of procedure  which  lays  down
the manner in which the evidence of the  complainant  may  be  recorded  and
once the Court issues summons and the presence of the  accused  is  secured,
an option be given to the accused  whether,  at  that  stage,  he  would  be
willing to pay the amount due along with  reasonable  interest  and  if  the
accused is not willing to pay, Court may fix up the case at  an  early  date
and ensure day-to-day trial.

can give his evidence by way of an affidavit and  such  affidavit  shall  be
read in evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceedings  in  the  Court,
which makes it clear that a complainant is not required to  examine  himself
twice i.e. one after filing the complaint and one  after  summoning  of  the
accused.  Affidavit and the documents filed by the  complainant  along  with
complaint for taking cognizance of the offence are good enough  to  be  read
in evidence at both  the  stages  i.e.  pre-summoning  stage  and  the  post
summoning stage.  In other words, there is no necessity to  recall  and  re-
examine the complaint after summoning  of  accused,  unless  the  Magistrate
passes a specific order as to why the complainant is to be  recalled.   Such
an order is to be passed on an application made  by  the  accused  or  under
<a href="/doc/109927775/" id="a_70">Section 145(2)</a> of the Act suo moto by the Court.  In  summary  trial,  after
the accused is summoned, his plea is to be  recorded  under  <a href="/doc/1159163/" id="a_71">Section  263(g)</a>
Cr.P.C. and his examination, if any, can be  done  by  a  Magistrate  and  a
finding can be given by the Court under <a href="/doc/167317/" id="a_72">Section 263(h)</a> Cr.P.C. and the  same
procedure can be followed by  a  Magistrate  for  offence  of  dishonour  of
cheque since offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_73">Section 138</a>  of  the  Act  is  a  document  based
offence.  We make it clear that if the proviso (a), (b)  &amp;  (c)  to  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_74">Section
138</a> of the Act are  shown  to  have  been  complied  with,  technically  the
commission of the offence stands completed and it  is  for  the  accused  to
show that no offence could have been committed by him for  specific  reasons
and defences.

year and an amount of fine exceeding Rs.5,000/- and it is  further  provided
that in the course of a summary trial, if it appears to the Magistrate  that
the nature of the case requires passing  of  the  sentence  of  imprisonment
exceeding one year, the Magistrate, after hearing  the  parties,  record  an
order to that effect and thereafter recall any witness and proceed  to  hear
or rehear the case in the manner provided in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_85"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_24">19.   This Court in Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed  Babalal  H.   (2010)  5  SCC
663, laid down certain guidelines while interpreting <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_86">Sections  138</a>  and  <a href="/doc/177946336/" id="a_87">147</a>
of  the  Negotiable  Instruments  Act  to  encourage  litigants  in   cheque
dishonour cases to opt for compounding during early stages of litigation  to
ease choking of criminal justice system for graded scheme of imposing  costs
on parties who unduly delay compounding of offence, and for  controlling  of
filing  of  complaints  in  multiple   jurisdictions   relatable   to   same
transaction, which have also to be borne in mind  by  the  Magistrate  while
dealing with cases under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_88">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_25">20.   We notice, considering all those  aspects,  few  High  Courts  of  the
country have laid down certain  procedures  for  speedy  disposal  of  cases
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_89">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments  Act.   Reference,  in  this
connection, may be made to the judgments of the Bombay  High  Court  in  KSL
and Industries Ltd. v. Mannalal Khandelwal  and  The  State  of  Maharashtra
through the Office  of  the  Government  Pleader  (2005)  CriLJ  1201,  Indo
International Ltd. and another v. State of Maharashtra  and  another  (2005)
44 Civil CC (Bombay) and Harischandra Biyani v.  Stock  Holding  Corporation
of India Ltd. (2006) 4 MhLJ 381, the judgment of the Calcutta High Court  in
 Magma Leasing Ltd. v. State of West Bengal and others (2007) 3 CHN 574  and
the judgment of the Delhi High Court in Rajesh Agarwal v. State and  another
(2010) ILR 6 Delhi 610.
</p>
<p id="p_26">21.   Many of the directions given by the various High Courts, in our  view,
are worthy of emulation by the Criminal Courts all over the country  dealing
with cases under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_90">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments  Act,  for  which
the following directions are being given :-
</p><p id="p_27">DIRECTIONS:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">     1)     Metropolitan Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate (MM/JM), on the day
        when the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_91">Section 138</a> of the Act is presented, shall
        scrutinize the complaint and, if the complaint  is  accompanied  by
        the affidavit, and the affidavit and the  documents,  if  any,  are
        found to be in  order,  take  cognizance  and  direct  issuance  of
        summons.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">     2)     MM/JM should adopt a pragmatic  and  realistic  approach  while
        issuing summons.  Summons must be properly addressed  and  sent  by
        post as well as by e-mail address got from the complainant.  Court,
        in appropriate cases, may take the assistance of the police or  the
        nearby Court to  serve  notice  to  the  accused.   For  notice  of
        appearance, a short date be fixed.  If the summons is received back
        un-served, immediate follow up action be taken.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">     3)     Court may indicate in the summon that if the accused  makes  an
        application for compounding of offences at the first hearing of the
        case  and,  if  such  an  application  is  made,  Court  may   pass
        appropriate orders at the earliest.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_60">     4)     Court should direct the accused, when he appears to  furnish  a
        bail bond, to ensure his appearance during trial  and  ask  him  to
        take notice under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_92">Section 251Cr</a>.P.C. to enable  him  to  enter  his
        plea of defence and fix the case for defence  evidence,  unless  an
        application is made by the accused under  <a href="/doc/109927775/" id="a_93">Section  145(2)</a>  for  re-
        calling a witness for cross-examination.
</blockquote><p id="p_28">   (5)      The Court concerned must ensure that examination-in-chief, cross-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">        examination and re-examination of the complainant must be conducted
        within three months of assigning the case.   The Court  has  option
        of accepting affidavits of the witnesses, instead of examining them
        in Court.  Witnesses to the complaint and accused must be available
        for cross-examination as and when there is direction to this effect
        by the Court.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">22.   We, therefore, direct all the Criminal Courts in the  country  dealing
with <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_94">Section 138</a> cases to follow the above-mentioned procedures  for  speedy
and  expeditious  disposal  of  cases  falling  under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_95">Section  138</a>  of  the
Negotiable Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_30">23.   Writ Petition is, accordingly, disposed of, as above.
