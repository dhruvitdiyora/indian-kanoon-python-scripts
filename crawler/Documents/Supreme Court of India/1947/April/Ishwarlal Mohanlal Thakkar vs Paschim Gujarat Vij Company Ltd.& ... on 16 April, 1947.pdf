<p id="p_1">V.Gopala Gowda, J.
</p>


<p id="p_2">       Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">   2. This appeal is filed by the appellant against the final  judgment  and
   order dated 19.04.2011, passed by the High Court of Gujarat at  Ahmedabad
   in Special Civil Application No. 4168 of 2002,  whereby  the  High  Court
   allowed the petition filed by the respondent under Articles 226  and  227
   of the Constitution of India, praying for issuance of an appropriate writ
   or direction for quashing and setting aside the judgment and award  dated
   31.7.2001 passed by the Labour Court, Bhavnagar in Reference(LCB)  No.225
   of 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_4">   3.  Brief facts of the case are stated hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_5">        The  appellant  was  the  employee  of  the   erstwhile   Bhavnagar
   Electricity Company Ltd. which was taken over by the respondent-board and
   the appellant was appointed afresh as per  the  agreement  in  1978.  The
   appellant gave an application in the year 1987 to change his  birth  date
   from 27.6.1937 to 27.6.1940 but he was orally informed of  the  rejection
   of his request. The Executive Engineer of the respondent-board  addressed
   a letter to the appellant directing  him  to  produce  a  school  leaving
   certificate or Municipal Birth certificate as proof and  stated  that  in
   the absence of production of the required documents, the  date  of  birth
   recorded in the service  book  shall  be  final.  The  appellant’s  elder
   brother filed a criminal application no.227 of 1987 wherein it was prayed
   that the Registrar of Birth and Date Records, Bhavnagar  be  directed  to
   enter the date of birth of the appellant as 27.6.1940 on its record and a
   birth certificate be issued. The Court  of  the  JMFC  vide  order  dated
   22.05.1987 directed the Bhavnagar Municipal Corporation(BMC) to  issue  a
   birth certificate to the  appellant.  Pursuant  to  this  order  a  birth
   certificate was issued by the BMC, the Xerox copy of which is  marked  as
   Ex.52, wherein his date of birth was shown as  27.6.1940.  The  appellant
   forwarded the birth certificate issued by the BMC to  the  respondent  on
   25.5.1987 and sent a reminder on 11.6.1987 to  make  corrections  in  the
   service record with regard to his date of birth. He was informed  by  the
   Executive Engineer of the respondent-board that he  has  to  produce  his
   original school leaving certificate or SSC pass certificate in  order  to
   effect corrections in the service records. The Electricity Board vide its
   circular dated 28.5.1989 informed all the employees that for the  purpose
   of deciding date  of birth and making  corrections  for  the  same,  only
   School Leaving Certificate of SSC or HSC may be taken into account.
</p>
<p id="p_6">   4. As his date of birth was not corrected, the appellant  filed  a  civil
   suit in the year 1997 for declaration regarding his  date  of  birth  and
   prayed for interim relief, but the same was rejected.  He  then  filed  a
   civil misc. appeal No.124 of 1997 before the District  Court,  Bhavnagar,
   against the order of the civil court, but this also came to be  rejected.
   The respondent-board, on 27.6.1997, pursuant to the date of birth in  its
   records, terminated the services  of  the  appellant  and  the  appellant
   raised an industrial dispute  before the Conciliation Officer  which  was
   referred by the  State  Government  for  adjudication  to  Labour  Court,
   Bhavnagar vide reference(LCB)  no.225  of  1998.  The  Labour  Court  has
   allowed the reference after conducting an enquiry  and  passed  an  Award
   dated 31.7.2001 holding that the  termination  of  the  services  of  the
   appellant prematurely on the basis of his incorrect  date  of  birth  was
   wrong and further  directed  the  respondent  to  pay  full  salary,  all
   admissible ancillary  benefits  from  the  date  he  was  wrongfully  and
   prematurely  terminated  from  service  till  the  date  of  his   actual
   retirement and further, also ordered that a sum of Rs.1,500/- be paid  as
   costs. The respondent filed a petition under Articles 226 and 227,  being
   special civil application no.4168  of  2002  before  the  High  Court  of
   Gujarat at Ahmedabad. The same was allowed and the award  passed  by  the
   Labour Court in Reference(LCB) No.225 of 1998 was set aside. Aggrieved by
   the same, the appellant has filed the present civil appeal urging various
   facts and legal contentions in support of his case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   5. Mr. P.H. Parekh, the learned senior  counsel  for  the  appellant  has
   argued that the appellant came to know about his wrongly  mentioned  date
   of birth in his service record of the respondent in the year  1987  only.
   Prior to that, he had no knowledge about the incorrect recording  of  his
   date of birth and so he immediately made representation to the respondent
   for its correction which was not acceded and therefore, he had raised the
   industrial dispute and the Labour Court had recorded its finding  in  the
   Award after adjudication of the dispute and held that there was no  delay
   on the part  of  the  appellant  in  approaching  his  employer  and  the
   Conciliation Officer  to correct his date of birth as he  had  approached
   it within reasonable time. It is contended by him  that  the  appellant’s
   submission with respect to his date of  birth  is  based  on  documentary
   evidence i.e the birth certificate issued by the BMC, the Xerox  copy  of
   which is Ex.52 herein. Further, the  LIC  Policy,  Ex.42  for  which  the
   premium was paid by the respondent on behalf of the appellant to the Life
   Insurance Corporation and the same was deducted from his monthly  salary,
   mentions his date of birth as 27.6.1940. There was an apparent mistake in
   his school records and it is submitted that the appellant approached  the
   authorities for rectification of the same  on  the  basis  of  the  birth
   certificate issued by BMC and the school authorities  rectified  it.  The
   learned senior counsel submitted that the birth certificate issued by the
   BMC is a legally binding document and that the appellant was prematurely,
   arbitrarily  and  illegally  superannuated  from  his  services,  without
   notice, even though the respondent was aware of the appellant’s real date
   of birth as the same was reflected in  records  namely  :  Identity  Card
   issued by the Bhavnagar Electricity Co., the Birth Certificate issued  by
   the BMC, the Certificate of birth date issued by  the  principal  of  the
   appellant’s school, statement of employees  and  their  relevant  details
   handed over by the Bhavnagar Electricity Co. to  the  respondent  at  the
   time of takeover, confidential reports maintained by  the  respondent  in
   its records and lastly the LIC Policy by which premium was paid.  It  was
   further contended that the High Court erred in not appreciating that  the
   respondent, by permitting other employees to correct their date of  birth
   by merely producing an affidavit has discriminated against the  appellant
   by refusing to correct the  date  of  birth  even  on  production  of  an
   affidavit and a birth certificate issued by the BMC pursuant to an  order
   of the JMFC court and other such documents furnished to it for correction
    that also formed part of the respondent’s own record  of  its  employees
   which proved the date of birth of the appellant to be 27.6.1940  and  not
   27.6.1937.
</p>
<p id="p_8">   6. On the other hand, Ms. Hemantika Wahi, the  learned  counsel  for  the
   respondent submits that the respondent-board had taken over the erstwhile
   Bhavnagar Electricity Co. in the year 1978 and  whatever  service  record
   was  available  with  the  erstwhile  company  was  transferred  to   the
   respondent-board and as per the said record, birth date of the  appellant
   was 27.6.1937.  It  is  submitted  that  the  appellant  signed  all  the
   documents with open eyes and it was open for him to raise  the  issue  of
   the alleged wrong date of birth in the year 1978 but he did not take  any
   steps towards that till the year 1987. It was further contended that  the
   confidential reports was signed by him every  year  and  there  also  his
   birth date was indicated  as  27.6.1937  and  the  service  book  of  the
   appellant also reflects the same and all this evidence has  estopped  him
   from contending any birth date other than 27.6.1937. The learned  counsel
   has raised the point that  the  Labour  Court  merely  on  the  basis  of
   conjectures and surmises and without assigning any detailed justification
   or reasons has accepted the birth certificate issued by the  BMC  to  the
   appellant with the date of  birth  as  27.6.1940  and  is  thus  ex-facie
   illegal and, therefore, the  findings  and  reasons  recorded  by  it  is
   rightly set aside by the High Court in exercise of its power of  judicial
   review.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   7. We have heard the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of both  the
   parties. The following questions would arise for our consideration:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            i. In the event that there is a dispute in the  date  of  birth
               between  the  birth  certificate  issued  by  the  competent
               authority and the school leaving certificate, which document
               will prevail?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           ii. Whether the High Court  was  correct  in  passing  an  order
               setting aside the judgment and Award of the Labour Court?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          iii. What Award?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">   8. We will first examine the award and judgment of the Labour Court.  The
   Labour court while passing  its  award  and  judgment  has  given  cogent
   reasons for the same. The labour  court  examined  all  the  evidence  on
   record and held that as per Ex.36 which is the certificate of birth given
   by the school for the brother of the appellant, Batuklal Mohanlal Thakker
   wherein his date of birth is written as 27/1/1937 and  therefore,  it  is
   impossible that the appellant’s date of birth would be 27/6/1937  as  the
   difference would be only 5 months and so it is clear that when  both  the
   brothers joined the  school,  the  Director/Principal  had  inadvertently
   written date of birth which revealed from Court’s order  and  hence,  the
   date of birth in the school record for the  appellant  was  corrected  to
   27/6/1940 as per the court’s order. The Labour Court further went  on  to
   observe that before the court order, as and when the  applicant  got  the
   chance, he gave an application to the respondent organisation vide letter
   dated 18.4.1987 requesting them to correct  his  date  of  birth  as  per
   documents enclosed – the statement of the Bhavnagar  Electricity  Company
   Ltd, his Identity card and copy of the LIC policy, all  of  which  showed
   his date of birth as 27.6.1940, and to record the entry  in  the  service
   records. The respondent did not accept the same and  the  appellant  then
   got a court order dated 22.05.1987 which directed the entry  of  date  of
   birth of the appellant as 27.6.1940 to be passed in the  Birth  &amp;  Deaths
   Register but in spite of this order, the respondent did not  accept  such
   judicial/court evidence or the government documents. They  neither  cared
   to inform the appellant that they did not accept the  documents  nor  did
   they give him any opportunity to defend his application and  retired  him
   arbitrarily by taking an ex-parte decision which is illegal  and  against
   the principles of natural justice. The  Labour  Court  then  went  on  to
   observe that in the case of other employees,  the  dates  of  birth  were
   corrected on the basis of affidavits but in the case of the appellant, in
   spite of producing a court order  and  other  documents,  they  were  not
   accepted by the respondent and  thus,  this  action  of  the  respondent,
   retiring the applicant from service was illegal and unconstitutional  and
   against the principles of natural justice. Thereby the reference  of  the
   appellant was  accepted  and  the  respondent  was  ordered  to  pay  the
   appellant full salary along with all admissible ancillary  benefits  from
   the date he was retired till the date of his actual retirement as per his
   date of birth, and Rs.1,500/- towards costs of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_11">   9.  We find the judgment and award of the labour court well-reasoned  and
   based on facts and evidence on record. The High Court has  erred  in  its
   exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India to annul
   the findings of the labour court in its Award as it is well  settled  law
   that the High Court cannot exercise its power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article  227</a>  of  the
   Constitution as an appellate court or re-appreciate evidence  and  record
   its findings on the contentious points. Only if there is a serious  error
   of law or the findings recorded suffer from error apparent on record, can
   the High Court quash the order of a lower court. The Labour Court in  the
   present case has satisfactorily exercised its original  jurisdiction  and
   properly appreciated the facts and legal evidence on record and  given  a
   well reasoned order and answered the points of dispute in favour  of  the
   appellant. The High Court had no reason to interfere with the same as the
   Award of the labour court was based on sound and cogent reasoning,  which
   has served the ends of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      It is relevant to mention that in the case of Shalini Shyam  Shetty  &amp;
   Anr. v. Rajendra Shankar Patil[1],  with regard to the limitations of the
   High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a>, it was held in
   para 49 that-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               “The power of interference under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Art.227</a> is to be kept to  a
               minimum to ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to
               a  halt  and  the  fountain  of  justice  remains  pure  and
               unpolluted in order to maintain  public  confidence  in  the
               functioning of the tribunals and courts subordinate  to  the
               High Court.”




   It was also held that-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">               “High Courts cannot, at the drop of a hat,  in  exercise  of
               its  power  of  superintendence   under   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_5">Art.227</a>   of   the
               Constitution, interfere with  the  orders  of  tribunals  or
               courts inferior to it. Nor  can  it,  in  exercise  of  this
               power, act as a court of appeal over the orders of the court
               or tribunal subordinate to it.”




   Thus it is clear, that the High Court has to  exercise  its  power  under
   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_6">Article 227</a> of the Constitution judiciously and to further  the  ends  of
   justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        In  the  case  of  Harjinder  Singh  v.  Punjab  State   Warehousing
   Corporation[2], this Court held that,

               “20……In view of the  above  discussion,  we  hold  that  the
               learned Single Judge of the  High  Court  committed  serious
               jurisdictional error and unjustifiably interfered  with  the
               award of reinstatement  passed  by  the  Labour  Court  with
               compensation of Rs.87,582 by entertaining a wholly unfounded
               plea that  the  appellant  was  appointed  in  violation  of
               Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and the Regulation.”




</blockquote><p id="p_13">   10. The power of judicial review of the High Court has to be  alluded  to
   here to decide whether or not the High Court has erred in  setting  aside
   the judgment and order of the labour court. In the case  of  Heinz  India
   Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. State of UP &amp; Ors.[3], this  Court  referred  to  the
   position held on the power of judicial review in  the  case  of  Reid  v.
   Secretary of State for Scotland[4], wherein it is stated that :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              “Judicial review involves a challenge to the  legal  validity
              of the decision. It does not allow the  court  of  review  to
              examine the evidence with a view  to  forming  its  own  view
              about the substantial merits of the case. It may be that  the
              tribunal  whose  decision  is  being  challenged   has   done
              something which it had no lawful authority to do. It may have
              abused or misused the authority which it  had.  It  may  have
              departed from the procedures which either by  statute  or  at
              common law as a matter of fairness it ought to have observed.</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">              As regards the  decisions  itself  it  may  be  found  to  be
              perverse or irrational or grossly  disproportionate  to  what
              was required. Or the decision may be found to be erroneous in
              respect of a legal deficiency, as for  example,  through  the
              absence of evidence, or of sufficient  evidence,  to  support
              it, or through account being taken of irrelevant  matter,  or
              through a failure  for  any  reason  to  take  account  of  a
              relevant matter, or through some misconstruction of the terms
              of the  statutory  provision  which  the  decision  maker  is
              required to apply. But while the  evidence  may  have  to  be
              explored in order to see if the decision is vitiated by  such
              legal deficiencies it is perfectly  clear  that  in  case  of
              review, as distinct from an ordinary appeal,  the  court  may
              not set about forming its own preferred view of evidence.”




   Therefore, in view of the above judgments we have to hold that  the  High
   Court has committed a grave error by setting aside the findings  recorded
   on the points of dispute in the  Award  of  the  labour  court.  A  grave
   miscarriage of justice has been committed against the  appellant  as  the
   respondent should have accepted the birth  certificate  as  a  conclusive
   proof of age, the same being an entry in the public record as per <a href="/doc/1034981/" id="a_7">Section
   35</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the birth  certificate  mentioned
   the appellant’s date of birth as  27.6.1940,  which  is  the  documentary
   evidence. Therefore, there was no reason to deny him the benefit  of  the
   same, instead the respondent-board prematurely terminated the services of
   the appellant by taking his date of birth as 27.6.1937 which is  contrary
   to the facts and evidence  on  record.  This  date  of  birth  is  highly
   improbable as well as impossible as the  appellant’s  elder  brother  was
   born on 27.1.1937 as per the School Leaving Certificate, and there cannot
   be a mere 5 months difference between the birth of his elder brother  and
   himself. Therefore, it is apparent that the  School  Leaving  Certificate
   cannot be relied upon by the  respondent-board  and  instead,  the  birth
   certificate issued by the BMC which is the  documentary  evidence  should
   have been relied upon by the respondent. Further, the  date of  birth  is
   mentioned as 27.6.1940 in the LIC insurance policy on the basis of  which
   the premium was paid by the respondent to the Life Insurance  Corporation
   on behalf of the appellant. Therefore, it is only just  and  proper  that
   the respondent should have relied on the birth certificate issued by  the
   BMC on the face of all these discrepancies as the same was issued on  the
   order of the JMFC. The High Court has wrongly held that the appellant was
   estopped from raising the issue of his date of birth as he had signed the
   records in 1978 but he raised this issue only in  1987.  The  reason  for
   this is clear that the respondent came out with a circular in  1987  that
   those employees who wished to change their date of birth in  the  records
   may do so by furnishing the necessary birth certificate and further, they
   can do it before they become 50 years  of  age.  The  appellant  had  not
   attained 50 years of age at the time he raised the  contention  regarding
   mistake in his date of birth. The High Court has not applied its mind  in
   setting aside the judgment and award of the labour court in  exercise  of
   its power of judicial review and superintendence as it is patently  clear
   that the labour court has not committed  any  error  of  jurisdiction  or
   passed a judgment without sufficient evidence. The impugned judgement and
   order of the High Court deserves to  be  set  aside  and  the  award  and
   judgment of the labour court be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_15">   11. In view of the aforesaid reasons, we allow the appeal, set aside  the
   impugned judgment and order of the High Court and restore  the  award  of
   the Labour Court, since the services of the  appellant  were  prematurely
   superannuated  taking  his  date  of  birth  as  27.06.1937  instead   of
   27.06.1940, and therefore, he is entitled to full back  wages  and  other
   consequential monetary benefits from the date  of  termination  till  the
   date of his correct superannuation  considering  his  date  of  birth  as
   27.06.1940. The back wages shall be calculated on the  basis  of  revised
   pay scale and the same must be  paid  by  way  of  demand  draft  to  the
   appellant within six weeks from the date of receipt of the copy  of  this
   order, failing which the respondent shall pay interest @ 12% per annum on
   the amount due, towards  back  wages  and  other  consequential  monetary
   benefits, from the date of the Award of the Labour Court till the date of
   payment.
