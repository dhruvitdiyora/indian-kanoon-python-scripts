<p id="p_1">1.          Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          The issue that arise for our consideration and decision in  this
batch of appeals is,  whether  the  revenue  is  legally  responsible  under
<a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_1">Section 244A</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short, “the Act”) for  payment
of interest on the  refund  of  tax  made  to  the  resident/deductor  under
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">Section 240</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_3">3.          At the outset, it is relevant  to  notice  that  the  assessment
years in all these appeals are on and after 01.04.1989, that  is  after  the
admittance of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_3">Section 244A</a> of the Act by Direct Tax  Laws  (Amendment)  Act,
1987 (4  of  1988)  with  effect  from  01.04.1989,  whereby  provision  for
interest on refunds on any amount due to the  assessee  under  the  Act  was
introduced.
</p>

<p id="p_4">FACTS:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.          We would refer to the facts in Civil Appeal No.  6301  of  2011.
The respondent is a company incorporated under the provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_4">Companies
Act</a>, 1956. It is engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  nitrogenous  fertilizer.
During the assessment year 1997-98, the respondent-company had  commissioned
its naptha desulphurization plant and to oversee the operation of  the  said
plant it had sought the assistance  of  two  technicians  from  M/s.  Haldor
Topsoe, Denmark.  M/s. Haldor Topsoe had raised an  invoice  aggregating  to
US$ 43,290,06/- as service charges for  services  of  the  technicians  (US$
38,500/-) and reimbursements of expenses (US$ 4,790/-).
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.          The resident/deductor had  approached  the  Income  Tax  Officer
under <a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_5">Section 195</a> (2) of the  Act  inter  alia  requesting  him  to  provide
information/ determination as to what percentage of tax should  be  withheld
from the amounts  payable  to  the  foreign  company,  namely,  M/s.  Haldor
Topsoe, Denmark.  On the request so made, the Assessing Officer/ Income  Tax
Officer had determined and passed Special order under  <a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_6">Section  195</a>  (2)  of
the Act directing the resident/ deductor to  deduct/  withhold  tax  at  the
rate of  20%  before  remitting  aforesaid  amounts  to  M/s.Haldor  Topsoe.
Accordingly, the resident/ deductor had deducted  tax  of  Rs.1,98,878/-  on
the entire amount of US$ 43,290.00/- and credited the same in favour of  the
Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.          After such deposit, the  resident/  deductor  had  preferred  an
appeal  before  the  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  (Appeals)  against   the
aforesaid order passed by the Assessing Officer/ Income  Tax  Officer  under
<a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_7">Section 195</a> (2) of the Act.  The  appellate  authority  while  allowing  the
appeal so  filed  by  the  resident/  deductor,  had  concluded,  that,  the
reimbursement of expenses is not a part of the income for deduction  of  tax
at source under <a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_8">Section 195</a> of the Act and accordingly, directed the  refund
of the tax that was deducted and paid over to the Revenue on the  amount  of
US$  4790.06/-  representing  reimbursement  of  expenses  by  order   dated
12.07.2002.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7.          After  disposal  of  the  appeal,  the  resident/  deductor  had
claimed the refund of tax on US$ 4790/- (amounting to Rs.22,005/-) with  the
interest thereon as provided under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_9">Section 244A(1)</a> of the Act by its  letter
dated 09.12.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.          The Assessing Officer/ Income Tax Officer  while  declining  the
claim made, has observed, that, <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_10">Section 244A</a> provides for interest  only  on
refunds due to the assessee under the Act and not to the deductor and  since
the refund in the instant case is in view of  the  circulars  viz.  Circular
No. 769 and 790 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (for short  “the
Board”) and not under the statutory  provisions  of  the  Act,  no  interest
would accrue on the refunds under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Section 244A</a> of the Act.   Therefore,  the
Assessing Officer/Income Tax Officer while granting refund of the  tax  paid
on the aforesaid amount has refused to entertain the claim for  interest  on
the amount so refunded by order dated 29.07.2003.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.          Since the Assessing Officer/Income Tax Officer had  declined  to
grant the interest on the amount so refunded,  the  resident/  deductor  had
carried the matter by way of an appeal before  the  Commissioner  of  Income
Tax (Appeals).  The First Appellate Authority by its order dated  28.03.2005
has approved the orders passed by the Assessing Officer/ Income Tax  Officer
and declined the claim of the deductor/resident on two  counts  :  (a)  that
the refund in the instant case would fall under two circulars viz.  Circular
No. 769 and 790 issued by the Board  which  specifically  provide  that  the
benefit of interest under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_12">Section 244A</a> of the Act on such refunds would  not
be available to the deductor/ resident and (b) that a  conjoint  reading  of
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_13">Section 156</a> and the explanation appended to <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_14">Section 244A</a> (1)(b) of  the  Act
would indicate that the amount refunded to the deductor/resident  cannot  be
equated to the refund of the amount(s) envisaged  under  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_15">Section  244A(1)(b)</a>
of the Act, wherein only the interest  on  refund  of  excess  payment  made
under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_16">Section 156</a> of the Act pursuant  to  a  notice  of  demand  issued  on
account of post-assessment tax is  contemplated  and  not  the  interest  on
refund of tax deposited under self-assessment as in the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.         The deductor/resident, aggrieved by  the  aforesaid  order,  had
carried the matter before the Income  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal  (for  short,
“the Tribunal”).  The  Tribunal  while  reversing  the  judgment  and  order
passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)  has  opined,  that,  the
tax was paid by the deductor/ resident pursuant to  an  order  passed  under
<a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_17">Section 195</a> (2) of the Act and the refund was ordered under <a href="/doc/774356/" id="a_18">Section  240</a>  of
the Act,  therefore,  the  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_19">Section  244A(1)(b)</a>  are  clearly
attracted and the revenue is accountable for  payment  of  interest  on  the
aforesaid refund amount.  Accordingly, the Tribunal has allowed  the  appeal
of the deductor/ resident and directed the  Assessing  Officer/  Income  Tax
Officer to acknowledge the claim and allow the interest  as  provided  under
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_20">Section 244A(1)(b)</a> of the Act on the aforesaid amount of  refund,  by  order
dated 28.06.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.         The Revenue being of the view that they are treated unfairly  by
the Tribunal had carried the matter by way of Income Tax Appeal  before  the
High Court.  The High Court has refused to accept the appeal  filed  by  the
Revenue by the impugned judgment and order, dated 18.06.2009.  That  is  how
the Revenue is before us in these appeals.
</p>

<p id="p_13">12.         We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the Revenue  and
the respondent-assessee in these appeals  and  also  carefully  perused  the
orders passed by the forums below.
</p>

<p id="p_14">RELEVANT PROVISIONS:-
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.         To appreciate the view point of  the  learned  counsel  for  the
Revenue, we require to notice certain provisions of the  Act  prior  to  the
insertion of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_21">Section 244A</a> of the Act.   The  sections  that  require  to  be
noticed are; <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_22">Sections 156</a>, <a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_23">195(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/774356/" id="a_24">240</a> and <a href="/doc/1452933/" id="a_25">244</a> of the  Act.   A  perusal  of
these sections essentially would indicate  the  procedure  whereby  the  tax
amount is paid and the refund of excess amount is claimed by  the  assessee.
The relevant part of the said sections is sequentially reproduced:

<p id="p_18">15.         <a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_34">Section 195(1)</a> casts an obligation upon  every  person  in  this

remitted to a non resident/Foreign Company.  Sub Section (2) of <a href="/doc/1094500/" id="a_35">Section  195</a>
provides that where a person responsible for paying any such sum  chargeable
under the Act to a non resident/Foreign Company considers that the whole  of
such sum would not be the income chargeable in the  case  of  recipient,  he
may make an application to  the  assessing  officer/income  tax  officer  to
determine, by general or special order, the appropriate proportion  of  such
sum so chargeable. The assessing  officer  is  expected  to  determine  such
sum/tax which are deductible out of remittance to be sent to  the  recipient
and only after deduction and payment of such sum/tax, the balance amount  is
to be remitted  to  the  non-resident.  We  clarify  here  that  it  is  the
statutory obligation of the  person  responsible  for  paying  such  sum  to
deduct tax thereon before making payment, if such application is not  filed.

of  an  order  passed  in  appeal,  reference,  revision,  rectification  or
amendment proceedings, the assessing officer is bound to refund  the  amount
to the assessee without the assessee being required to  make  any  claim  in
that behalf.  The expression ‘other  proceedings  under  the  Act’  used  in
<a href="/doc/774356/" id="a_37">Section 240</a> of the Act, are wide enough  to  include  any  order  passed  in

not grant the refund within a period of three months from  the  end  of  the

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">       “11.2  Insertion of a new <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_50">section 244A</a> in lieu of <a href="/doc/883321/" id="a_51">sections 214</a>,  <a href="/doc/1692806/" id="a_52">243</a>

       financial year to the date of regular assessment. In case the refund

       the expiry of three months from the end of the month in  which  such
       order was passed to the date on which refund was granted.  The  rate

       gaps for which interest was  not  paid  by  the  Department  to  the
       assessee for money remaining with the  Government.  To  remove  this
       inequity, as also to simplify the provisions  in  this  regard,  the
       <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_57">Amending Act</a>, 1987, has inserted a new <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_58">Section 244A</a>  in  the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_59">Income

SUBMISSIONS:-
</p>
<p id="p_24">20.         Shri Arijit Prasad, learned counsel appearing  for  the  Revenue

then while refunding the amounts so paid, the Revenue need not  be  burdened
with payment of interest on the amount so refunded.  He  would  submit  that
while <a href="/doc/1097741/" id="a_65">Section 244A(1)(a)</a> specifically provides for the four instances  under
specific provisions where the interest would be payable  on  the  refund  of
tax paid, <a href="/doc/1795080/" id="a_66">Section 244A(1)(b)</a> does not provide for any specific instance  but
mentions “any other cases” and the explanation appended to the said  Section
requires payment of refund to be made in cases where notice  of  demand  was
issued under <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_67">Section 156</a> of the Act and since no demand  notice  was  issued
to the assessee under <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_68">Section 156</a> of the  Act  the  assessee  would  not  be
covered even by the aforesaid provision and hence, no  interest  is  payable
to the assessee by the Revenue.   It  is  further  submitted  that  interest
under <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_69">Section 244A</a> is to be granted in  case  where  refund  of  any  amount
becomes due to an assessee under this Act and the refund of tax deducted  at
source made to the deductor/resident is not under any  statutory  provisions
of the Act, the deductor/ resident is  not  entitled  for  interest  on  the
amount of tax deducted and deposited with the revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_25">21.          Per  contra,  learned  senior   counsel   appearing   for   the
resident/deductor would submit that since the  payment  made  under  <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_70">Section
195(2)</a> is payment made under the Act pursuant to  an  order  passed  by  the
assessing officer which in turn would be sheltered under the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_71">Section 156</a> of the Act, by virtue of clause(b) of sub-Section(1) of  <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_72">Section

</p>

<p id="p_26">DISCUSSION:-
</p>
<p id="p_27">22.         It is cardinal principle of interpretation of Statutes that  the
words of a Statute must be understood in their natural, ordinary or  popular
sense and construed according  to  their  grammatical  meaning  unless  such
construction leads to some absurdity or unless there  is  something  in  the
context or in the object of the Statute to the contrary.   The  golden  rule
is that the words of a Statute must prima  facie  be  given  their  ordinary
meaning.  It is yet another rule of construction that when the  words  of  a
Statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the Courts are bound to  give
effect to that meaning irrespective of the consequences.  It  is  said  that
the words themselves best declare  the  intention  of  the  law  giver.  The
Courts have adhered to the principle that efforts should  be  made  to  give
meaning to each and every word used by the  legislature  and  it  is  not  a
sound principle of construction to brush aside words in a Statute  as  being
inapposite surpluses, if they can have proper application  in  circumstances
conceivable within the contemplation of the Statute (See Gurudevdatta  VKSSS
Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra [2001] 4 SCC 534).
</p>
<p id="p_28">23.          It  is  also  well  settled  principle  that  the  courts  must
interpret the provisions of the Statute upon ascertaining the object of  the
legislation through the  medium  or  authoritative  forms  in  which  it  is
expressed.  It is well settled that the  Court  should,  while  interpreting
the provisions of the Statute, assign its ordinary meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_29">24.         This Court in <a href="/doc/1996092/" id="a_73">Shyam Sunder vs. Ram Kumar</a> (2001)  8  SCC  24  has
observed that in relation to beneficent construction,  the  basic  rules  of
interpretation are not to be applied where  (i)  the  result  would  be  re-
legislation of a provision by addition, substitution or alteration of  words
and violence would be done to the spirit  of  legislation,  (ii)  where  the
words of a Provision are capable of being given only one meaning  and  (iii)
where there is no ambiguity in a provision, however,  the  Court  may  apply
the rule of beneficent construction in order to advance the  object  of  the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_30">25.         Before the  insertion of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_74">Section 244A</a> as a composite Section  by
the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, the liability to pay interest  on

assessment year 1989-90 and onwards.
</p>

<p id="p_31">26.         The language of the Section is precise, clear  and  unambiguous.
Sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_82">Section 244A</a> speaks of interest on refund of the  amounts
due to an assessee under the Act. The assessee  is  entitled  for  the  said

clause (a) &amp; (b) of sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_83">Section  244A</a>.   In  calculating  the
interest payable, the section provides for different dates  from  which  the
interest is to be calculated.

<p id="p_32">27.         Clause(a) of sub-Section(1) of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_84">Section 244A</a> talks of payment  of

less than 10% of the tax determined under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_88">Section 143(1)</a> of the  Act  or  on
regular assessment. Clause(b) of Sub-Section(1) of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_89">Section 244A</a>  opens  with
the words "in any other case" that means in any case other than the  amounts
paid under Clause(a) of Sub-section(1) of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_90">Section 244A</a>.  Under this  clause,
the rate of interest is to be calculated at the rate of one and a  half  per
cent per month or a part of a month comprised in the period or  the  periods
from the date or, as the case may be, either the dates  of  payment  of  the
tax or the  penalty  to  the  date  on  which  the  refund  is  granted.  An
explanation is  appended  to  clause(b)  of  the  aforesaid  sub-Section  to
explain the meaning of the expression "date of payment of tax  or  penalty".
It clarifies that the “date of payment of tax or  penalty”  would  mean  the
date on and from which the amount of tax or penalty specified in the  notice
of demand issued under <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_91">section 156</a> is paid in excess of such demand.
</p>

<p id="p_33">28.         Having glanced through the relevant  sections  and  the  settled
legal principles of interpretation of Statute, let us  revert  back  to  the
factual situation placed before us in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_34">29.         In the present case, the resident/ deductor had  approached  the
assessing authority inter alia requesting him  to  determine  the  tax  that
requires to be deducted at source before the  payment  is  made  to  a  non-
resident/foreign company. On  such  a  request  the  assessing  officer  had
passed an order under <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_92">Section 195(2)</a> of  the  Act  directing  the  resident/
deductor to deduct tax at a particular  rate.  The  resident/  deductor  had
appealed against the said order, but had deposited the tax  as  directed  by
the  assessing  officer/Income  Tax  Officer  by  the  aforesaid  order   in
accordance with  the  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/609896/" id="a_93">Section  200</a>  of  the  Act.  When  the
resident/deductor succeeded in the appeal, a direction  was  issued  by  the
appellate authority for refund of tax so paid. In observance  of  the  same,
the assessing authority had granted the  refund  of  the  tax  amount  under
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_94">Section 240</a> of the Act, but declined to grant interest on  the  said  refund
amount. The conclusion arrived at by the assessing officer was  accepted  by
the first appellate authority on the ground, inter alia, that  the  conjoint
reading of <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_95">Section 156</a> and the explanation appended  to  <a href="/doc/1795080/" id="a_96">Section  244A(1)(b)</a>
of the Act  would  indicate  that  the  amount  refunded  to  the  resident/
deductor  cannot  be  equated  to  the  refund  contemplated  under  <a href="/doc/1795080/" id="a_97">Section
244A(1)(b)</a> of the Act, whereunder only the  interest  on  refund  of  excess
payment made under <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_98">Section 156</a> of the Act on account of post-assessment  tax
is contemplated and not the interest on refund of tax deposited under  self-
assessment. However, the Tribunal has rejected the  aforesaid  rationale  of
the assessing authority  as  well  as  the  first  appellate  authority  and
granted the claim of the resident/deductor. The High Court has endorsed  the
view of the Tribunal and dismissed the appeals filed the Revenue.
</p>

<p id="p_35">30.         The refund becomes due when tax deducted at source, advance  tax
paid, self assessment tax paid and tax paid on  regular  assessment  exceeds
tax chargeable for the year as a result of an  order  passed  in  appeal  or
other proceedings under  the  Act.   When  refund  is  of  any  advance  tax
(including tax deducted/collected at source), interest is  payable  for  the
period starting from the first day of the assessment year  to  the  date  of
grant of refund.   No interest is, however, payable if  the  excess  payment
is less than 10 percent  of  tax  determined  under  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_99">Section  143(1)</a>  or  on
regular assessment.  No interest is payable for the  period  for  which  the
proceedings  resulting  in  the  refund  are   delayed   for   the   reasons
attributable to the assessee (wholly or partly). The rate  of  interest  and
entitlement to interest on  excess  tax  are  determined  by  the  statutory
provisions of the Act.  Interest payment is a statutory obligation and  non-
discretionary in nature to the assessee. In tune with the aforesaid  general
principle, <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_100">Section 244A</a> is drafted and enacted.   The language  employed  in
<a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_101">Section 244A</a> of the Act is clear and plain. It grants substantive  right  of
interest and is not procedural. The principles for  grant  of  interest  are
the same as under the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_102">Section 244</a>  applicable  to  assessments
before 01.04.1989, albeit  with  clarity  of  application  as  contained  in
<a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_103">Section 244A</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_36">31.         The Department has also issued Circular clarifying  the  purpose
and object of introducing <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_104">Section 244A</a> of the Act to replace  <a href="/doc/958277/" id="a_105">Sections  214</a>,
<a href="/doc/536158/" id="a_106">243</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_107">244</a> of the Act.  It is clarified  therein,  that,  since  there  was
some lacunae in  the  earlier  provisions  with  regard  to  non-payment  of
interest by the revenue to the assessee for the  money  remaining  with  the
Government, the said section is introduced for payment of  interest  by  the
Department for delay in grant of refunds.  A general  right  exists  in  the
State to refund any tax collected  for  its  purpose,  and  a  corresponding
right exists to refund to individuals any sum paid by them  as  taxes  which
are found to have been wrongfully exacted or are believed  to  be,  for  any
reason, inequitable.  The statutory obligation to  refund  carried  with  it
the right to interest also.  This is true in the case of assessee under  the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_37">32.         The question before us  is,  whether  the  resident/deductor  is
also entitled to  interest  on  refund  of  excess  deduction  or  erroneous
deduction of tax at source under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_108">Section 195</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_38">33.         We would begin our discussion by referring to circular No.  790,
dated 20.04.2000, issued by the Board. Omitting what is not  necessary,  the
material portion of the circular is extracted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">           “........
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">           6.    Refund to the person making payment under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_109">Section  195</a>  is
      being allowed as income does not  accrue  to  the  non-resident.   The
      amount paid into the Government account in such cases,  is  no  longer
      ‘tax’. In view of this, no interest under <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_110">section 244A</a>  is  admissible
      on refunds to be granted in accordance with this Circular  or  on  the
      refunds already granted in accordance with Circular No. 769.”


</blockquote><p id="p_39">34.         What the deductor/ resident primarily contend is that, what  has
been deposited by him is a tax, may be for and on  behalf  of  non-resident/
foreign company and when the beneficial circular provides for refund of  tax
to the deductor under certain circumstances, the refund of tax should  carry
interest.
</p>
<p id="p_40">35.         The circular issued by  Central  Board  of  Direct  Taxes  (“the
Board” for short) is binding on  the  department.   Binding  nature  of  the
circular is explained by this Court in the case of UCO Bank v. CIT  237  ITR
889, wherein this Court has observed that the circulars issued by the  Board
in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/618701/" id="a_111">Section 119</a> of the Act would be  binding  on
the income tax authorities even if they deviate from the provisions  of  the
Act, so long as they seek to mitigate the rigour  of  a  particular  Section
for the benefit of the assessee.  Therefore, we cannot be  taking  exception
to the reasoning and conclusion reached by the authorities  under  the  Act.
However, the Tribunal and the High  Court,  have  granted  interest  on  the
amount of tax deposited by the resident/ deductor from the date  of  payment
on the ground,  firstly,  the  refund  of  tax  is  directed  by  the  first
appellate authority in the appeal filed  by  the  deductor/  resident  under
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_112">Section 240</a> of the Act and secondly, the Revenue  for  having  retained  the
sum by way of tax has to compensate the person who had deposited the tax.
</p>
<p id="p_41">36.         <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_113">Section 240</a> of the Act provides for refund of  any  amount  that
becomes due to an assessee as a result of an order in appeal  or  any  other
proceedings under the Act.  The phrase “other proceedings under the Act”  is
of wide amplitude. This Court has  observed,  that,  the  other  proceedings
under the Act would include orders passed under <a href="/doc/1951329/" id="a_114">Section  154</a>  (rectification
proceedings), orders passed  by  the  High  Court  or  Supreme  Court  under
<a href="/doc/1581703/" id="a_115">Section 260</a> (in reference), or order passed by the Commissioner in  revision
applications under <a href="/doc/1978286/" id="a_116">Section 263</a> or in an application under <a href="/doc/1072783/" id="a_117">Section 273A</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_42">37.         A “tax refund” is a refund of taxes when the  tax  liability  is
less than the tax paid.  As per the old section  an  assessee  was  entitled
for payment of interest on the amount  of  taxes  refunded  pursuant  to  an
order passed under the Act, including the order passed in an appeal. In  the
present fact scenario, the deductor/assessee had paid taxes  pursuant  to  a
special order passed by the assessing officer/Income Tax  Officer.   In  the
appeal filed against the  said  order  the  assessee  has  succeeded  and  a
direction is issued by the appellate authority to refund the tax paid.   The
amount paid by the resident/ deductor was retained by the Government till  a
direction was issued by the appellate authority to refund  the  same.   When
the said amount is refunded it  should  carry  interest  in  the  matter  of
course.  As held by the Courts while awarding interest,  it  is  a  kind  of
compensation of use and retention of the money collected  unauthorizedly  by
the Department.  When the collection  is  illegal,  there  is  corresponding
obligation on the revenue to refund such amount with interest in as much  as
they have retained and enjoyed the money  deposited.   Even  the  Department
has understood the object behind insertion of  <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_118">Section  244A</a>,  as  that,  an
assessee is entitled to payment of interest for  money  remaining  with  the
Government which would be refunded.  There is  no  reason  to  restrict  the
same to an  assessee  only  without  extending  the  similar  benefit  to  a
resident/ deductor who has deducted tax at source  and  deposited  the  same
before remitting the amount payable to a non-resident/ foreign company.
</p>
<p id="p_43">38.   Providing for payment of interest in case of refund of  amounts  paid
as tax or deemed tax or advance tax is a method now statutorily adopted  by
fiscal legislation to ensure that the aforesaid amount  of  tax  which  has
been duly paid in prescribed time and provisions in that behalf  form  part
of the recovery machinery provided in a taxing  Statute.   Refund  due  and
payable to the assessee is debt-owed and   payable  by  the  Revenue.   The
Government, therebeing  no  express  statutory  provision  for  payment  of
interest on the refund of  excess  amount/tax  collected  by  the  Revenue,
cannot shrug off its apparent obligation to reimburse the deductors  lawful
monies with the accrued interest for the period of undue retention of  such
monies.  The State having received the  money  without  right,  and  having
retained and used it,  is  bound  to  make  the  party  good,  just  as  an
individual would be under like circumstances.   The  obligation  to  refund
money received and retained without right implies and carries with  it  the
right to interest.  Whenever money has been received by a party which ex ae
quo et bono ought to be refunded, the  right  to  interest  follows,  as  a
matter of course.
</p>
<p id="p_44">39.         In the present case, it is not in doubt that the payment of  tax
made by resident/ depositor is in  excess  and  the  department  chooses  to
refund the excess payment of  tax  to  the  depositor.   We  have  held  the
interest requires to be paid on such refunds.  The catechize  is  from  what
date interest is payable, since the present case does not fall either  under
clause (a) or (b) of <a href="/doc/689872/" id="a_119">Section 244A</a> of the Act.  In the absence of an  express
provision as contained in clause (a), it cannot be said  that  the  interest
is payable from the 1st of April of  the  assessment  year.  Simultaneously,
since the said payment is  not  made  pursuant  to  a  notice  issued  under
<a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_120">Section 156</a> of the Act, Explanation to clause (b)  has  no  application.  In
such cases, as the opening words of clause (b) specifically referred to  “as
in any other case”, the interest is payable from  the  date  of  payment  of
tax. The sequel of our discussion is the resident/deductor is  entitled  not
only the refund of tax deposited under <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_121">Section 195(2)</a> of the  Act,  but  has
to be refunded with interest from the date of payment of such tax.
</p>
<p id="p_45">40.   In  the  result,  the  appeals  fail.  Accordingly,  the  appeals  are
dismissed.  No order as to costs.
