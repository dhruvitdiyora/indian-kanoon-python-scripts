</p>
<p id="p_70">              On 24.09.2002 at about 4.30 p.m., two persons

     armed with AK-56 rifles, hand grenades etc.                     entered

     the precincts of the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple

     situated at Gandhinagar, Gujarat from gate No.3. They

     fired indiscriminately towards the children, games and

     rides    and     started      throwing      hand    grenades.     While

     continuing the attack, they reached gate No. 2 of the

     temple     and        fired    at    the      worshippers, devotees,

     volunteers and visitors and then proceeded towards the

     main building. Since the main door of the temple was

     locked,        they     moved       towards        the   Sachchidanand

     Exhibition Hall, killing and injuring women, children

     and others. Thereafter, immediately CRPF personnel,

     Deputy    Inspector        General     (DIG),      Gujarat   State and

     other senior police officers along with SRP commandos

     rushed to the place of offence to return the fire.

     Ambulances were called and other police forces were

     police commandos climbed on the roof.                 By that time,

     the terrorists (fidayeens) once again started firing.

     A fierce gun battle ensued, and there was also a bomb

     blast.

     arrived by a chartered flight and took control at

     about    12.00   at   midnight.       After       understanding     the

     topography of the area, they began the counter attack

     against the fidayeens.            Exchange of firing continued

     and lasted for nearly 5 hours which went on into the

     wee hours of 25.9.2002.           Eventually both of them were

     killed in the early morning hours as they succumbed to

     the injuries received in the said operation.                      It is

     were    seized     along      with     other       articles     from    the

     premises.        The attack resulted in the killing of 33

     persons, including NSG commandos, personnel from the

     State Commando Force and three other persons from SRP

     and jawans were grievously injured.                     Those who were

     injured or killed during the attack were removed to

        referred to the judgments of this Court. Reliance was

        wherein this Court rejected the contention urged on

        behalf of the accused persons that the confessional

        statements were inadmissible                 in evidence because (a)

        the   statements         were    recorded     by    the    investigating

        in the case of Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab3 were

        Chaganlal Raghani &amp; Ors.4, wherein this Court held the

        confessional statements of the accused persons to be

        admissible in evidence. The Court further held that

        confessional    statements   having    been   proved     to   be

        voluntarily made and legally recorded, can be used

        against all or some of the accused persons in the

        that the acts subsequent to achieving an object of

        criminal        conspiracy          may     tend       to   prove     that     a

        conspiracy. Conspiracy is hatched in private or in

        secrecy        and    it    is    rarely    possible        to   establish    a

        conspiracy           by    direct    evidence.         Usually,     both     the

        in mind the time constraints on the police officers in

        the present system, the ill equipped machinery they

        have    to      cope       with   and     the    traditional        apathy    of

        The High Court also relied upon the case of Rotash v.

        State of Rajasthan7, wherein this Court held that the

     Sanjay Gadhvi, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-IV)

     (PW-78: Ex.452), Ahmedabad, who had been examined by

     confessional statements of the accused persons were

     provisions    of    POTA    were    explained        to    the     accused

     persons   before    their    statements       were        recorded,         and

     (Recording Officer) to send the accused to judicial

     persons complain of ill-treatment or torture by the

     police.    All the accused persons who made confessional

     statements appeared before the CJM (PW-99), and they

     made no complaint against the police and they had also

     admitted   the     statement    made      by    them.    The    Division

     facts and evidence on record indicate free will of the

     recorded the statement of A-1 and A-3 on the request

     made his confessional statement on 05.10.2003 and was

     With regard to cross examination of PW-99, he admitted

     that he had not inquired from the accused persons as

         safeguards provided under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_117">Section 32</a> of POTA have been

         followed by PW-78 to record the statements of the

         accused persons as per the guidelines issued by the

         Apex Court in various judgments particularly State of

         Tamil     Nadu    v.    Nalini   &amp;    Ors.(supra)    and    Jayawant

         Court came to the conclusion that this Court in the

         case of Devender Pal Singh v. State of NCT of Delhi10

         held that the initial burden is on the prosecution to

         prove that all the requirements under Section 15 of

         TADA and Rule 15 of TADA Rules were complied with.

         Once that is done and the prosecution discharges its

         burden, then it is for the accused to satisfy the

     court that the confessional statement was not made

     voluntarily. The High Court opined that in present

     case, each accused making confessional statement was

     granted time of around 15 minutes to reflect over his

     decision to make confessional statement, and the High

     Court stated that there is no evidence on record to

     suggest that 15 minutes time was inadequate so as to

     render    the    confessional      statements    inadmissible       in

     evidence or unreliable as none of the five accused

     persons while making the confessional statement had

     asked    for    further    time.    None   of   them   had   made   a

     complaint of inadequacy of time before PW-99 and on

     the other hand, admitted the confessions made by them.

     made by the learned counsel for the accused persons

     that they were kept in police custody for around 45

     days before the official date of arrest, is absolutely

     unbelievable.       Further, sending the accused persons to

     judicial       custody    after    recording    the    confessional

     requirement. PW-99 had made a specific note on the

     writings (Exs. 453, 455, 457, 459 and 461), that each

     of    the   accused    person      was     asked    whether   he    had

     suffered ill-treatment at the hands of the police and

     that none of them had complained of ill-treatment by

     the police. The Division Bench held the confessional

     statements of the accused persons to be admissible in

     evidence in order to prove their guilt, relying on

     various decisions of this Court.

<p id="p_118">     32.    After    recording       such      findings,    the    defence

     evidence       was     also       examined.        Defence    witness

     (hereinafter ‘DW’) Nos. 1 to 7 have given evidence and

     the same have been adduced by the defence to support

     their claim that the accused persons were arrested

     long before the official date recorded and that they

     were tortured by the police to make the confessional

     statements. The aforesaid evidence of DW-3 referred to

     A-2   and   A-3.     The   High    Court    referred    to    all   the

     defence witnesses, except DW-3 to hold that none of

     the aforesaid evidence remotely supports the defence

     version that A-2 and A-3 were arrested long before

     29.08.2003, i.e the dates of arrest as mentioned in

     their   arrest     memos.    The     High     Court    held    that        the

     evidence of the doctors also does not prove the police

     atrocities      allegedly         committed     upon     the        accused

     persons during the period they were in the police

     custody.     All    the     six     accused    persons,        in        their

     retraction      statements,        complained     of     having           been

     beaten up by ACP Singhal (PW-126), V.D. Vanar and R.I.

     Patel, because of which they could not stand up on

     their   feet.      On     denying     their    complicity           in     the

     Akshardham    attack,       they     were     threatened       of        being

     encountered. Each accused persons said that every day

     they were called either by Singhal, V.D. Vanar or by

     R.I. Patel and were forced to admit their complicity

     in the Akshardham attack. On 05.11.2003, the accused

     persons were produced before the Special Court (POTA)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010         -46-</span>




     from the judicial custody. Each one of them was given

     audience before the judge of the Special Court (POTA)

     wherein, they all made an oral complaint of police

     atrocities      during   the   police     custody    and    also

     complained of having been in police custody for long

     time. According to each accused person, he was made to

     sign the confessional statement prepared by the police

     under coercion and duress and had not made the same of

     his own free will.
</p>
<p id="p_119">          At paragraph 144 of the impugned judgment, the

     Division Bench of the High Court had recorded its

     finding that the aforesaid retractions are ex facie

     unbelievable, without giving any reason.

</p><p id="p_120">     33. At para 145 of the impugned judgment, the High

     Court examined the evidence in respect of the letters

     written    in    Urdu    (Ex.658),      which   is   a     vital

     incriminating evidence against A-4.         According to the

     defence, these letters were planted by the police at a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010           -47-</span>




     later stage, and they placed reliance on the evidence

     of PW-42 (Ex.266), the inquest Panchnama(Ex.267) of

     the bodies of the deceased fidayeens, the post mortem

     notes(Ex.492 and Ex.493) and the muddamal clothes of

     the fidayeens and submitted that since both of them

     died of bullet wounds sustained during the counter

     attack by the NSG commandos, the bodies were wounded

     and soiled in blood, and their clothes were tattered

     by the bullet holes and the splinters. There were

     holes in the clothes of the fidayeens particularly on

     the   pockets   of   their      trousers.    In   the    aforesaid

     circumstances, it is not possible that the letters

     recovered allegedly from the pockets of the trousers

     of    the   fidayeens    were     unsoiled    and   in     perfect

     condition, and therefore, the expert opinion (Ex.511)

     is not very accurate and is not reliable. The High

     Court stated that it is true that the Urdu letters

     recovered from the bodies of the deceased fidayeens

     were in perfect condition in spite of the multiple
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                 -48-</span>




     injuries received by the fidayeens and assigned the

     reason in paragraph 189 of the impugned judgment as

     “But then the truth is stranger than fiction” and that

     it is not possible to disbelieve that two Urdu letters

     (Exh.658)       were      recovered     from    the     bodies    of     the

     fidayeens. It was stated by the High Court that both

     the letters were signed by Brig. Raj Sitapati of NSG.

     The   recovery       of    these   letters      is     recorded    in    the

     muddamal    articles        as   per    list    (Ex.524)       which    were

     received by ACP G.L Singhal (PW-126) in the premises

     of Akshardham temple itself under Panchnama (Ex.440),

     signed by the Police Officer Shri Prakashchandra Mehra

     (PW-105    :    Exh.592).        The    evidence      and   the   opinion

     (Exh.511) of the handwriting expert J.J.Patel (PW-89:

     Exh.507)       was   relied      upon    to    prove    that     the    said

     letters were written by A-4.
</p>
<p id="p_121">     34. The argument advanced by the learned counsel for

     the accused persons regarding the subsequent planting

     of letters was rejected by the High Court, stating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010         -49-</span>




     that if this argument was to be accepted, then the

     aforesaid evidence adduced by the prosecution has to

     be disbelieved and it has to be held that the police

     had such presence of mind that in the:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          “milieu of the aftermath of the terrorist
          attack, the police thought of creating the
          evidence, found out a person who knew Urdu,
          got them to write the write-ups in handwriting
          that would match the handwriting of accused
          no.4, Abdul Kayyum, made Lt.Col Lamba and

          Vinod Kumar(PW-74) and Dilip Sinh (PW-1). This
          possibility is too far-fetched to believe.”



     The High Court therefore held that the accused persons

     had committed offences for which they had been charged

     and confirmed the conviction and sentence, i.e. death

     sentence    awarded      to   A-2,    A-4   and   A-6,   life-

     The correctness of the impugned judgment and orders

     passed by the High Court is under challenge in these

     appeals by the accused – appellants, in support of

     which they urged various facts and legal contentions

     before this Court.

     We will first examine the contentions urged on behalf

     of the prosecution represented by Mr. Ranjit Kumar,

     the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the

     State   of   Gujarat     who   has     advanced        the     following

     arguments    to   establish    the     guilt      of     the     accused

</p>
<p id="p_125">     The procedure under <a href="/doc/1869380/" id="a_118">Section 50</a> of POTA was followed by

</p><p id="p_126">     36. It was contended by the learned senior counsel

     that    on    completion        of   the     investigation,        PW-126

     forwarded a complete set of papers and his report

     through      official      channel     recommending           prosecution

     against all six accused persons under the provisions

     of POTA. The sanction granted by the Home Department

     was given under the signature of the Deputy Secretary

     of the said department, Mr. J.R Rajput by sanction no.

     SB.V/POTA/10/2003/152 (Ex.498). All the papers were

     received by the sanctioning authority on 12.11.2003

     and the section officer put up the file to the Under

     Secretary on 13.11.2003 and after proper application

     of mind, the sanction was approved by Kuldeep Chand

     Kapur, Principal Secretary, Home Department (PW-88) on

     15.11.2003 and it was sent back to the Minister for

     State     (Home)    who     approved        it    on    18.11.2003      and

     received     back       these   papers      from       the   Minister    on

     19.11.2003 and thereafter sanction order was issued on

     21.11.2003.        It     was    further         submitted     that     the

        procedure for granting sanction by the Home Department

        was followed as per the Gujarat Government Rules of

        Business, 1990. It was submitted that the sanction

        order was passed by the State Government after proper

        application of mind by the competent authority.

        The learned senior counsel also submitted that the

        learned counsel for A-6, Ms. Kamini Jaiswal placed

        reliance on the case of Ramanath Gadhvi v. State of

        Gujarat11 qua the sanction under <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_119">Section 20-A</a> (2) of

     <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_120">Section      32</a>   of    POTA    was    scrupulously        followed.     The

     accused      persons      did    not        make    any    complaints     of

     beatings or ill treatment by the police when produced

     before the CJM for remand on different dates. When the

     complaints were made later, a medical examination was

     carried out in which none of the complaints were found

     to be true. The learned senior counsel also submitted

     that the confessional statements of A-2 and A-4 were

     recorded on 24-09-2003, that of A-3 on 17-09-2003 and

     that    of   A-6    on   05-10-2003.          A-5   did    not    make   any

     confession         at    all.         The     retraction         to   these

     confessional statements came around five weeks later.

     He contended that it is clear that these retractions

     are    mechanical       as   even     A-5,    who    had   not    made   any

     confessional statement, sent his retraction.

     The Urdu letters were collected from the dead bodies

     of the two fidayeens:

     Prakashchandra         Mehra    (PW-105:       Exh.592),         who     in   his

     statement has confirmed the collection of the two Urdu

     letters.    PW-91,       Maj.     Jaydeep         Lamba,     who       was    the

     commander of the task force, also stated that two Urdu

     letters    were     found       from    the       dead     bodies      of     the

     fidayeens by him and Brig. Raj Sitapati, and that they

     contain the signature of Brig. Raj Sitapati at the

     bottom and that a list was prepared of the articles

     recovered (Ex.524) which` was signed by him.

     Reliance was also placed by the learned senior counsel

     on   the   evidence      of    PW-89     who      had    opined     that      the

     letters (Ex.658) had been written by A-4.

     The learned senior counsel also submitted that PW-91

     deposed    before       the    court,       and    that     in     his       cross

     examination,      he     was     not    questioned          regarding          the

     ‘condition’       of    the     letters        written      in     Urdu,       as

     recovered from the two fidayeens. Similarly, even PW-

     126 was not cross examined by the counsel for the

     accused persons on the condition of the letters. On

     being questioned by us as to why the letters did not

     have any blood stains on them, the learned senior

     counsel submitted that the panchnama stated that the

     trousers were stained with blood and not soaked with

     it. Their trousers became wet due to the oozing of

     blood   which   has   gone   to    the    back   of    the   trousers

     because of gravity as the bodies were lying on their

     back after shooting.

     the link between them and the attack on the Akshardham

</p><p id="p_146">     46. <a href="/doc/1869380/" id="a_123">Section 50</a> of POTA provides that “no court shall

     take cognizance of any offence under the Act without

     the previous sanction of the Central Government or as

     the   case   may    be    by   the     State   Government.”    The

     prosecution has relied on the testimony of Kuldeep

     Chand Kapoor (PW-88) to prove that the sanction was

     granted in accordance with the law.
</p>
<p id="p_147">     It was contended by the learned counsel for A-6 that

     the perusal of the statement of PW-88 would show that

     all the documents pertaining to the investigation were

     not placed before the sanctioning authority and it was

     only on the approval of the Minister that the sanction

     was   granted.     The   sanction    was   granted   without   due

     application of mind. Thus the said sanction is not a

     proper previous sanction, on the basis of which the

     court could have taken cognizance of the offences.

     4 and A-3 and A-5 respectively, that the prosecution

     had not complied with the statutory provisions under

        48 hours as provided under <a href="/doc/429716/" id="a_125">Section 32(4)</a> of POTA. It

        is contended that after recording their statements,

        CJM (PW-99) failed to discharge the vital obligation

        of     sending      them       to   judicial       custody     and        thus,

        committed a grave error in remanding them back to

        police custody which was a clear violation of <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_126">Section

        32(5)</a> of POTA and <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_127">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution.

        It was submitted that the Division Bench of the High

        Court      had     erroneously      made     an    observation       in     the

        impugned judgment in this regard with reference to

        <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_128">Section 32(5)</a> of POTA, stating that the Chief Judicial

        Magistrate         has   the    power   to        send   a   person       to   a

        judicial         custody   only      when     he     complains       of    ill

        treatment and torture by the police. The aforesaid

        finding is contrary to the law laid down by this Court

        in NCT v. Navjot Sandhu.13

</p><p id="p_151">     48.     Further,   the     learned     senior     counsel    placed

     reliance on the deposition of PW-99 to contend that it

     leaves no manner of doubt that he was neither mindful

     of his obligations under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_129">Section 32</a> of POTA nor did he

     make any enquiry regarding fear or torture likely to

     have been faced by the accused persons while making

     their    confessional     statements.    On     the   contrary,    he

     mechanically sent the accused persons back to police

     custody    after   recording     their       statements.    It    was

     further submitted that the CJM had failed to perform

     the most important duty of informing himself about the

     surrounding circumstances for making the confessional

     statements    by   the     accused.     Remanding     the   accused

     persons to judicial custody has been considered as the

     most    significant      safeguard     and    protection    against

     torture by police, which was thrown to the wind by the

     CJM, thereby he had violated the fundamental rights

     guaranteed to the accused persons under Articles 20(3)

     and 21 of the Constitution. It was further contended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                 -65-</span>




     by the learned senior counsel that there was a failure

     on the part of the courts below in not considering the

     evidence of doctors who work in Government Hospitals

     and who deposed in the case on behalf of the accused

     persons    that     A-2    to    A-6    had     complained       of    having

     received     severe       beating       by     the     police    prior      to

     recording     the     confessional             statements.       The       said

     evidence     is     clear       from     the     depositions          of   DW-

     2(Ex.731),        DW-4(Ex.736),              DW-5(Ex.737)        and       DW-

     7(Ex.744). From the evidence of DW-2, it is revealed

     that the X-ray plates and case papers of A-4 were

     found missing and from the aforesaid evidence, the

     only conclusion that can be drawn is that once the

     accused    persons        had   complained        of    having    received

     severe beatings by the police prior to their making of

     their confessional statements, the credibility of such

     confessions became doubtful as the same had not been

     made voluntarily before PW-78 by them. Therefore, it

     had been urged that neither the Special Court (POTA)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010        -66-</span>




        nor the Division Bench of the High Court should have

        placed reliance upon the said confessional statements

        to record the finding of guilt against the accused

        persons. The courts below should have considered that

        there was a statutory obligation upon the prosecution

        not to suppress any evidence or document on record

        which indicates the innocence of the accused persons.

        Thus, in the light of evidence of DW-2, the conduct of

        the prosecution in the facts and circumstances of the

        case becomes unjustified. The learned senior counsel

        in support of the said contention placed reliance upon

        the decision of this Court in the case of Sidhartha

        Vashisht v. State (NCT of Delhi)14.
</p>
<p id="p_152">
</p><p id="p_153">        49. Further, the learned senior counsel on behalf of

        the accused persons contended that there were serious

        infirmities with regard to the manner in which the

        alleged confessional statements of the accused persons



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">14</span>
     (2010) 6 SCC 1

        were recorded without sufficient time being given for

        reflection, which was in violation of the principle

        laid down by this court in the cases of Ranjit Singh @

        Jita &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab15, Navjot Sandhu case

        (supra) and State of Rajasthan v. Ajit Singh &amp; Ors.16.

        It was further urged that the courts below had failed

        to take into consideration the element of fear of

        further torture by the police, in the minds of the

        accused         persons   which    was     bound    to   be   present,

        especially        when    their   confessional       statements   were

        recorded by PW-78 in his office without them being

        assured of being sent to judicial custody immediately

        after making their statements.               These above important

        facts      had      certainly      vitiated        the   confessional

        statements made by the accused persons, making them

        highly unreliable and unnatural. Therefore, the courts

        below should not have placed reliance on the same to

     record    the     finding       of   guilt     against         the     accused

     persons. The remaining evidence on record placed on

     behalf of the prosecution, does not establish even

     remotely that they were party to any of the material

     ingredients       of   the      conspiracy         of    the     attack      on

     Akshardham temple. In support of the said contention,

     the learned senior counsel invited our attention to

     concurrent       findings       of   fact    of     the     courts       below

     contending that the same are liable to be set aside as

     they     have     relied        solely      upon    the        confessional

     statements made by the accused persons while upholding

     their conviction. The courts below had gravely erred

     in not considering the very important legal aspect of

     the    matter,     that     a    trial      court       cannot       begin   by

     examining the confessional statements                     of the accused

     persons to convict them. It was contended that it must

     begin with other evidence adduced by the prosecution

     and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the

     quality and effect of other evidence, only then, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                -69-</span>




        court must turn to the confessions in order to be

        assured     as   to     the   conclusion       of    guilt,       which   the

        judicial mind is about to reach, based on the said

        other    evidence.       In   support     of    the      aforesaid    legal

        submissions he had placed reliance upon the judgment

        of this Court in the case of Haricharan Kurmi v. State

        of Bihar17 and the Navjot Sandhu case(supra).


</p><p id="p_154">        50. Further elaborating their submissions, the learned

        senior counsel urged that the confession of an accused

        person has been regarded by this Court as fragile and

        feeble evidence which can only be used to support

        other     evidence.      In   support     of    this       contention     he

        relied upon the judgment of this Court in the Prakash

        Kumar    v.     State    of   Gujarat18.       The       approach    of   the

        courts below to record the finding of guilt against

        the    accused     persons,     should     be       to    first     marshall

        evidence against the accused persons excluding their

<p id="p_156">
</p><p id="p_157">     51. The learned senior counsel Mr. A. Sharan appearing

     for A-3 and A-5 had further contended that the courts

     below had failed to take into consideration that the

     confessional statements made by the accused persons

     had   been    retracted        at      the   earliest   possible

     opportunity available to them. The evidence of the

     doctors that the sustained fracture being found on the

     bodies of the accused persons by the examining doctor

     and subsequent disappearance of the X-ray plates from

     the records, raised a series of doubts regarding the

     manner   in   which      the   confessional    statements   were

     recorded. In support of this contention the learned

     senior counsel placed reliance upon the decision of

     this Court in the case of Chandrakant Chimanlal Desai

        v. State of Gujarat19 . The learned senior counsel

        further contended that in the present set of facts,

        there     was    sufficient          proof     that    the     confessional

        statements were not made voluntarily and in the light

        of the above, the courts below were duty bound to

        corroborate       the     confessional         statements       with    other

        independent evidence to test their veracity.

        Learned senior counsel Mr. K.T.S Tulsi representing A-

        representing        A-6       have     reiterated        the     same     and

        submitted that there had to be independent evidence

        prosecution had placed reliance on the evidence of PW-

        50    as    substantial      evidence     against   the     accused

        persons. He contended that a careful reading of the

        evidence of         PW-50 showed that the said witness had

        clearly admitted that he was an accomplice in as much

        as he admitted to having contributed money, even when

        A-3 informed them that the money was to be used for

        taking revenge. It was further contended that a court

        should not rely on the evidence of an accomplice to

        record finding of guilt against the accused persons

        and    to       buttress   the   said    submission,   he   placed

        reliance upon the judgment of this Court in the case

        of Mrinal Das v. State of Tripura20. In support of the

        said submission, he had further placed reliance upon

        the judgment of this Court in the case of Bhiva Doulu

        Further elaborating his submission in this regard, he

        and held that corroboration must connect the accused

        persons with the crime.

<p id="p_160">        53. The learned senior counsel relied upon the case of

        Sarwan Singh v. State of Pubjab23, wherein this Court

        has laid down the legal principle that the courts are

        naturally reluctant to act on such tainted evidence

        unless      it    is    corroborated     and    that   independent

        corroboration should support the main story disclosed

        by the approver apart from a finding that the approver

        is a reliable witness. The accomplice evidence should

        satisfy a double test, i.e. he is a reliable witness

     a serious doubt about the manner in which the evidence

     was sought to be fabricated by police officer, D.G

     Vanzara whose entrusting of the case to the Crime

     Branch    on    28.08.2003     suddenly     resulted   in    feverish

     activity, whereupon the accused persons were arrested

     and their confessional statements were recorded.

     The learned senior counsel for the prosecution had

     relied upon the deposition of PW-52 who had stated in

     his evidence about sending money through A-3, as well

     as the weapons for the carnage and had also identified

     A-2, A-4 and A-5 before the Court. The learned senior

     counsel,       Mr.    K.T.S   Tulsi   submitted    that     the    said

     statement of this witness was exculpatory as he had

     stated that no work was assigned to him.                  Therefore,

     such     statement      can   neither      be   considered    to    be

     reliable        nor      worthy       of    acceptance        without

     corroboration in material particulars from independent

     sources.       In view of the test laid down by this court

     in a catena of judgments referred to supra, upon which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010              -77-</span>




     strong reliance had been placed by the learned counsel

     based on the presumption contained in illustration (b)

     of <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_137">Section 114</a> read with <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_138">section 133</a> of the Indian

     Letters purportedly recovered from the pockets of the

     fidayeens cannot be relied upon:
</p>
<p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">     57. Both the learned senior counsel, Mr. K.T.S Tulsi

     and Mr. A. Sharan contended that it was not possible

     to believe that the letters were recovered from the

     pockets of the two fidayeens, mainly on the evidence

     from   the    post    mortem    of    the    dead       bodies    of   the

     fidayeens which showed that the bodies had 46 and 60

     external      injuries,      respectively,         due    to     multiple

     bullet shots and the panchnama of the clothes of the

     assailants     clearly       demonstrated        that    their   clothes

     were   full    of    blood    and   mud    and    therefore,      it   was

     highly improbable and difficult to believe that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -78-</span>




     alleged letters were recovered in a perfect condition

     from the clothes of the fidayeens. The High Court had

     failed to reconcile the fact of absence of bullet

     holes on the letters with the presence of multiple

     bullet holes on the pockets of the trousers, from

     which     the   letters    were     purported   to    have      been

     recovered.       With regard to the letters being in a

     perfect condition, the High Court merely observed that

     “Truth is stranger than fiction” and it was submitted

     that the courts below ought not to have relied upon

     such a document to record their findings of guilt

     against the accused persons on the basis of the same.

</p><p id="p_168">     58.     The   learned    senior   counsel   also     referred     to

     various discrepancies in the statements of the two

     important witnesses in relation to the letters, i.e of

     PW-91, Lt. Col. Jayadeep Lamba, who, according to the

     prosecution, had recovered them from the pockets of

     the trousers of the fidayeens, but whose statement was

     not recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_140">Section 161</a> CrPC and that of PW-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                -79-</span>




     121, the translator of the letters. It was claimed by

     the prosecution that PW-91 was not examined by the

     investigation officer under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_141">Section 161</a> CrPC since the

     NSG had refused to grant permission to its personnel

     to disclose any information regarding their operation

     with respect to the attack. The prosecution had placed

     reliance    upon     a     letter      dated   11.02.2002       by    the

     Ministry    of   Home      Affairs      to   prove   the   same.      The

     learned senior counsel contended that the prosecution

     had however, relied upon the statement made by this

     witness, PW-91 before the Special Court (POTA), who

     was a chargesheet witness although his statement under

     <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_142">Section 161</a> CrPC was never recorded and thus, the

     accused    persons       had   been    naturally     deprived    of    an

     opportunity to effectively cross-examine the witness

     and thereby they were very much prejudiced.

</p><p id="p_169">     59. The learned senior counsel also contended that the

     claim of the prosecution that the letters were found

     in a pouch which was present in the pocket of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                -80-</span>




     trousers of the fidayeens cannot be believed as there

     is     no    evidence     to     support     the    same        and   on   the

     contrary,          the    receipt     voucher           of     the    articles

     collected          from    the      fidayeens       only         listed    two

     ‘handwritten letters in Urdu’ and there was no mention

     of the pouch whatsoever.

<p id="p_170">     Delay       in     recording     statements        of        accomplices   and

     confessional statements of the accused persons.


</p><p id="p_171">     60. The learned senior counsel, Mr. A. Sharan had

     submitted that the preliminary investigation of the

     case was initially carried out by the police from

     27.09.2002          and   thereafter,        the    investigation          was

     handed over to the ATS on 03.10.2002. After the matter

     was investigated for a year, it was transferred to the

     Crime Branch on 28.08.2003 and surprisingly, on the

     very        next    day   i.e,    29.08.2003,           all     the   accused

     persons, except A-6 were arrested and on 30.08.2003,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010           -81-</span>




     the   provisions   of    POTA   were     invoked   by    the   Crime

     Branch against them.
</p>
<p id="p_172">     61. It was further contended by him that this made the

     prosecution story highly improbable and the fact that

     the accused persons were apprehended a year after the

     incident made the conduct of the prosecution highly

     doubtful and totally unreliable.
</p>
<p id="p_173">     It was further contended by him that it is a well

     settled principle of law that there should not be an

     inordinate delay in the recording of the statements of

     the accomplices by the police. PW-50, PW-51, PW-52 and

     PW-56   had   stated     in   their     depositions     that   their

     statements were recorded around the 7th or 8th month of

     2003. Thus, this inordinate delay leads one to draw an

     adverse inference and also leads one to believe that

     the police had sufficient time to fabricate the story

     and rope in the accused persons falsely in this case.

     Reliance was placed by the learned senior counsel on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                    -82-</span>




        the case of State of Andhra Pradesh v. S.Swarnalatha &amp;

        Ors.30,     wherein     even      26    days        delay     in    recording

        statements of prosecution witnesses was not allowed by

        this Court.        The learned senior counsel also referred

        to    the   case   of     Jagjit   Singh        @     Jagga    v.   State   of

        Punjab31 in support of the above position of law.


        It    was   contended      that    the        delay    in     recording     the

        statements of the accused and witnesses by police and

        reliance placed upon the same by the courts below

        vitiated the finding recorded that the accused persons

        are guilty, and the same is liable to be set aside.

        There was delay in recording the statement of PW-52

        and PW-56 which is evident from the record that PW-52

        had    stated      that     his    statement           was     recorded     on

        07.09.2003, while PW-56 stated that his statement was

        recorded in the 7th or 8th month of 2003. Thus, there

     statement of the aforesaid witness by the Police.

     Failure of prosecution to establish a nexus between

     the accused persons and the crime as             well   as   link

     between the fidayeens and the accused persons.


</p><p id="p_174">     62. The learned senior counsel Mr. A. Sharan contended

     that for the prosecution to invoke common intention

     under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_143">Section 34</a> IPC or common object under <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_144">Section

     149</a> IPC, it is required to establish beyond reasonable

     doubt the connection between the accused persons and

     the common intention/object of the crime with which

     they are charged. In this regard, it was submitted

     that all the main prosecution witnesses, i.e PW-50,

     PW-51, PW-52 and PW-56 upon which strong reliance had

     been placed by the learned senior counsel on behalf of

     the prosecution, had failed to show and establish the

     nexus either with common intention or object, or the

     cumulative   effect      of   the     proved   circumstances,   to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010               -84-</span>




     establish any connection between the accused persons

     and   the    conspiracy         of   the    attack   on   Akshardham.

     Further, it was contended that the courts below had

     grossly     erred    in   placing     strong    reliance     upon    the

     evidence of above prosecution witnesses to hold that

     there was a link or connection between the fidayeens

     and   the   accused       persons,     and   that    it   was   on   the

     failure     of      the    prosecution        to     establish       such

     connection, that they had been subsequently roped in.

</p><p id="p_175">     63.   Further,      it    was    contended    that    even   from    the

     confessional statement of A-6, wherein he had narrated

     as to how the two fidayeens were brought from Jammu &amp;

     Kashmir to Gujarat, there was no mention of A-1 to A-

</p><p id="p_176">     5. Therefore, the prosecution had failed to establish

     the connection between A-6 and A-2, A-4, A-3 and A-5

     and this important aspect of the matter had not been

     considered at all by the courts below while recording

     the finding of guilt against the accused persons and

     the same cannot be allowed to sustain.

        prosecution witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_177">
</p><p id="p_178">        64. The learned senior counsel also contended that the

        courts below should have given same weightage to the

        evidence        of   the    defence       witnesses       as    that     of    the

        prosecution          witnesses        and        in    support         of     this

        contention,          he    placed    reliance         upon     the     cases    of

        inference against the prosecution.


</p><p id="p_179">        65. It was contended by the learned senior counsel

        that     PW-126       stated       that     his       senior    officer        D.G

        the details of the conspiracy, but D.G. Vanzara was

        never produced as a prosecution witness. The case is

        the    same      with    Brig.   Raj    Sitapati,          who   was    also   a

        witness to the recovery of the two Urdu letters, and

        this    material         witness   had        also      been     conveniently

        brushed aside both by the police and the prosecution.

        Reliance was placed by the learned senior counsel in

        this    regard      on    Tulsiram      Kanu       v.    The     State35,    Ram

        the    confessional         statement         of     A-4    that       the   two

        fidayeens,        i.e.    Doctor   1    (Murtuza/          Hafiz    Yasir)     &amp;

     Doctor 2 (Ashraf/Mohd. Faruk) belonged to Lahore and

     Rawalpindi    respectively.        As    per    the    confessional

     statement of A-6, the names of the two fidayeens were

     Sakil and Abdullah, who belonged to Jammu and Kashmir

     and had travelled along with A-6 to Gujarat. It was

     observed from the deposition of Maj. Jaydeep Lamba

     (PW-91) that it was written in the two Urdu letters

     that the two fidayeens were from ‘Atok’ region of

     Pakistan. It was submitted that the prosecution had

     come forth with three different versions insofar as

     the origin of the two fidayeens was concerned. Even

     the prosecution was not certain as to which of the

     three   versions    was    true.    It    was       submitted      that

     therefore,     in    the      presence         of     these     major

     discrepancies in the prosecution story, and the non-

     Judicial    Magistrate,       Badgaum.        A-6     was      brought    to

     Ahmedabad    on   12.09.2003       and       was     arrested      by    the

     Gujarat police in CR No. 314 of 2002 at 9:30 P.M.

     Confessional      statement       of    A-6     is       not     admissible

     against him.

<p id="p_186">

     the   prosecution        rested        solely       on      the    alleged

     confession of A-6 which was recorded on 05.10.2003

     (Exs.461-462), while he was in police custody. It had

     been submitted that there were several violations of

     the mandatory requirements of <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_147">Section 32</a> of POTA while

     recording his confessional statement. Learned senior

     counsel Mr. K.T.S Tulsi, appearing on behalf of A-2

     arguments    in    detail     as       to    how     the       confessional

     statements of the accused persons were not recorded in

     accordance with the mandatory procedural safeguards

     A-6,     Ms.Kamini      Jaiswal      had     alluded       to    them    with

     respect to A-6 also. Hence, we will not reiterate the

     same in this portion of the judgment.

     That the other evidence produced by the prosecution

     also does not point to the guilt of A-6.


</p><p id="p_188">     70.    The    learned    counsel      submitted          that   during    the

     remand of A-6, the investigation was carried on by V.D

     Vanar    (PW-112),      at    Bareilly       and    Ahmedabad.      He    had

     drawn panchnama of a PCO from where the accused had

     allegedly made telephone calls, but though he stated

     that    a    panchnama       was    drawn    at     Bareilly,      no    such

     panchnama had been brought on record. He was also said

     to    have    recorded       the    statement       of    PW-69,    Minhaas

     Ashfaq       Ahmed   who      had    stated        that    A-6     got    the

     ambassador car repaired at Das Motors and also the

     statement of one Dr. Sudhanshu Arya (PW-93) who had

     stated that the accused came to him for treatment of

     his child. However, it is contented that none of these

     incidents in any way connected the accused to the

     attack on the Akshardham temple.

<p id="p_189">     Some other evidence which the prosecution sought to

     rely    on   to   establish    the   guilt     of     A-6    were   the

     deposition of the owner of Gulshan Guest House, Yusuf

     Gandhi,      (PW-57:      Ex.328),       Panchnama     of    specimen

     signature of A-6 in the register of the guest house

     (Ex. 683), recovery of the ambassador car from the

     custody of the J &amp; K Police (Ex.672) and the report of

     the RTO regarding the ownership of the said ambassador

     car. (Ex.672).
</p>
<p id="p_190">     It was submitted that the register of the Guest House,

     which was seized around 27.08.2002 and 28.08.2002, was

     never     sealed,   and    that   the      pointing    out    of    the

     signature by A-6 while being in custody of the police

     was not admissible in evidence.

     It    was   further    submitted     that     with      regard   to    the

     ownership of the ambassador car, the report of the RTO

     (Ex.672), showed that it was registered in the name of

     Abdul Majid Rathor. The prosecution had also not been

     able to bring anything on record to connect A-6 with

</p><p id="p_194">     71.    It   was   contended    by    the     learned     counsel      that

     <a href="/doc/456804/" id="a_150">Section 51</a> of POTA, which starts with the non-obstante

     clause,     makes     it   mandatory       that   the    investigation

     under POTA be carried out only by the officer of the

     rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police or a police

     officer of an equivalent rank. It was argued that the

     investigation in the present case was mostly carried

     out by the officer of the rank of a Police Inspector.

     The POTA, unlike <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_151">CrPC</a> does not contain any provision

     where the powers of the I.O could be delegated to any

     other        person.      Thus,    it     was    contented      that     any

     investigation, if carried out by any officer below the

     rank of ACP is illegal and evidence, if any, collected

     during such investigation could not be looked at.

       incipient constitution in the case of State of West

       Bengal   v.    Anwar   Ali   Sarkar38,     made   an    observation

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             “90. I find it impossible to read these

             cannot blot out their history and omit from
             consideration the brooding spirit of the
             times. They are not just dull, lifeless words
             static and hide-bound as in some mummi-fied
             manuscript, but, living flames intended to
             give life to a great nation and order its
             being, tongues of dynamic fire, potent to
             mould the future as well as guide the
             present.   The  Constitution   must,  in   my
             judgment, be left elastic enough to meet from
             time to time the altering conditions of a
             changing world with its shifting emphasis and
             differing needs. I feel therefore that in
             each case judges must look straight into the
             heart of things and regard the facts of each
             case concretely much as a jury would do; and

     implementation has entailed, are continuing till date.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_210">     POTA was repealed for the gross violation of human

     rights it caused to the accused persons due to abuse

     of power by the police. This is an important aspect to

     be kept in mind while deciding this case and hence, it

     was pertinent to mention this in the beginning to say

     that we are wary of the abuse the provisions of this

     Act might bring. And we are conscious of it.

        v. State of Gujarat39, this Court, while examining a

        similar sanction Order as provided under Section 15 of

        TADA (repealed), has held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">              “8. Taking cognizance is the act which the
              Designated Court has to perform and granting
              sanction is an act which the sanctioning
              authority has to perform. Latter is a condition
              precedent for the former. Sanction contemplated
              in the sub-section is the permission to
              prosecute a particular person for the offence
              or offences under TADA. We must bear in mind
              that sanction is not granted to the Designated
              Court to take cognizance of the offence, but it
              is granted to the prosecuting agency to
              approach the court concerned for enabling it to
              take cognizance of the offence and to proceed
              to trial against the persons arraigned in the
              report. Thus a valid sanction is sine qua non
              for enabling the prosecuting agency to approach
              the court in order to enable the court to take
              cognizance of the offence under TADA as
              disclosed in the report. The corollary is that,
              if there was no valid sanction the Designated
              Court gets no jurisdiction to try a case
              against any person mentioned in the report as
              the court is forbidden from taking cognizance
              of the offence without such sanction. If the
              Designated Court has taken cognizance of the
              offence without a valid sanction, such action
              is without jurisdiction and any proceedings

              is the FIR in this case and the other is the

              All that the DGP had before him to consider the
              question of granting sanction to prosecute were
              the copy of the FIR and the application
              containing some skeleton facts. There is
              nothing on record to show that the Director

          safeguard whereunder the DSP was required to
          obtain the sanction/consent of the State
          Government, we are of the view that in the
          present case the same was given by the State
          Government without proper application of mind.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">          We    have   taken   this   view    because   the
          sanction/consent was given by the Government
          merely on the basis of the fax message dated
          17-3-1995 of the DSP. The reason for our saying
          so is that though there is no record a fax
          message of Deputy Director General of Police
          also,    which    is   dated    18-3-1995,    the
          sanction/consent order has mentioned above the
          fax message of the DSP only. Now, no doubt the
          message of the DSP is quite exhaustive, as
          would appear from that message which has been
          quoted above in full, we are inclined to think
          that before agreeing to the use of harsh
          provisions of TADA against the appellants, the
          Government ought to have taken some steps to
          satisfy itself whether what had been stated by
          the DSP was borne out by the records, which
          apparently had not been called for in the
          present case, as the sanction/consent was given
          post-haste on 18-3-1995, i.e., the very next
          day of the message of the DSP. It seems the DSP
          emphasised the political angle in the first two
          paragraphs of his message. The dispute or
          motive stated was that the Darbars were annoyed
          because they were refused loan and not because
          of   any   political  rivalry.   In   the   third
          paragraph there is reference to statements of
          accused after arrest which would ordinarily be
          inadmissible in evidence. Reference to avoid
          incident of the past does not provide any
          nexus. The State Government gave the sanction
          without even discussing the matter with the
          investigating officer and without assessing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010        -107-</span>




          situation independently. All these show lack of
          proper and due application of mind by the State
          Government while giving sanction/consent.”

                              (emphasis laid by this Court)



     It was the Deputy Secretary, Law and Order, Mr. J.R

     Rajput who had signed the document of sanction issued

     in the name of the Governor (Ex.498). However, he was

     not examined by the Court. On the other hand, PW-88,

     the Principal Secretary was examined. Therefore, we

     intend to examine the statement of PW-88, since he

     formed the only link in the Home Ministry of State of

     Gujarat and could enlighten us with the facts and

     information which were taken into consideration by him

     while granting sanction.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_223">     While deposing before the Special Court (POTA), PW-88

     stated that he had not discussed anything with the

     Home Minister regarding the grant of sanction and the

     Minister had simply signed the proposed note as a mark

     of approval. PW-88 further stated that he had not

        discussed       anything     with       the     I.O    about    granting

        sanction in the present case. However, the Special

        Court    (POTA)      erroneously    justified         the   granting   of

        sanction on the ground that the learned counsel for A-

        2 and A-4 before the Special Court (POTA), Mr. R.K.

        Shah, did not insist on examination of the internal

        note    and     at   no   stage   was    such    a    request   made   in

        writing.

               material   and    evidence   collected   during

               satisfaction whether prosecution has to be
               sanctioned or not. The mind of the sanctioning

            grant   sanction   vests  absolutely   in   the
            sanctioning authority, its discretion should be
            shown to have not been affected by any
            extraneous consideration. If it is shown that
            the sanctioning authority was unable to apply
            its independent mind for any reason whatsoever
            or was under an obligation or compulsion or
            constraint to grant the sanction, the order
            will be bad for the reason that the discretion
            of the authority “not to sanction” was taken
            away and it was compelled to act mechanically
            to sanction the prosecution.”

        Since this Act makes a departure from the established

        the   Constitution,      the   constitutionality   of   the    Act

        came to be challenged before this Court in the case of

        Peoples Union of Civil Liberties v. Union of India42.

        The    Court    upheld   the   constitutionality   of   the    Act

        after taking into account all the provisions which

        seemingly violate the fundamental rights guaranteed

        under the Constitution. For the purpose of this case,

        we intend to record the finding of this court with

        respect to the provisions of <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_178">Section 32</a>. The relevant

          “63.  Concerning the validity and procedural
          difficulties that could arise during the
          process    of    recording      confessions,      the
          Petitioners submitted that there is no need to
          empower the police to record confession since
          the accused has to be produced before the
          Magistrate within forty-eight hours, in that
          case the magistrate himself could record the
          confession; that there is no justification for
          extended the time limit of forty eight hours
          for producing the person before the Magistrate;
          that it is not clear in the Section whether the
          confession recorded by the police officer will
          have validity after Magistrate has recorded the
          fact of torture and has sent the accused for
          medical examination; that it is not clear as to
          whether both the confession before the police
          officer as well as confessional statement
          before   the   Magistrate     shall   be    used   in
          evidence; that the Magistrates cannot be used
          for mechanically putting seal of approval on
          the confessional statements by the police;
          that,   therefore,    the    Section    has   to   be
          nullified.    Validity    of   this    Section    was
          defended by the learned Attorney General by
          forwarding the arguments that the provisions
          relating to the admissibility of confessional
          statements, which is similar to that of
          <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_179">Section 32</a> in     POTA was      upheld      in Kartar
          Singh case ; that the provisions of POTA are an
          improvement over TADA by virtue of enactment of
          <a href="/doc/918253/" id="a_180">Sections 32(3)</a> to <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_181">32(5)</a>;      that    the     general
          principles of law regarding the admissibility
          of a confessional statement is applicable
          under POTA; that the provision which entails
          the   Magistrate   to    test    and   examine    the
          voluntariness of a confession and complaint of
          torture is an additional safeguard and does not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -117-</span>




          in   any  manner  inject   any  constitutional
          infirmity; that there cannot be perennial
          distrust of the police; that Parliament has
          taken into account all the relevant factors in
          its totality and same is not unjust or
          unreasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_234">          64. At the outset it has to be noted that
          Section 15 of TADA that was similar to this
          Section was upheld in Kartar Singh case (pp.
          664-83 of SCC). While enacting this Section
          Parliament has taken into account all the
          guidelines, which were suggested by this Court
          in Kartar Singh case. Main allegation of the
          Petitioners is that there is no need to empower
          the police to record confession since the
          accused   has  to   be   produced  before   the
          Magistrate within forty-eight hours in which
          case the Magistrate himself could record the
          statement or confession. In the context of
          terrorism the need for making such a provision
          so as to enable Police officers to record the
          confession was explained and upheld by this
          Court in Kartar Singh case (p. 680 para 253 of
          SCC). We need not go into that question at this
          stage. If the recording of confession by police
          is found to be necessary by Parliament and if
          it is in tune with the scheme of law, then an
          additional safeguard under <a href="/doc/429716/" id="a_182">Sections 32(4)</a> and
          (5) is a fortiori legal. In our considered
          opinion the provision that requires producing
          such a person before the Magistrate is an
          additional safeguard. It gives that person an
          opportunity to rethink over his confession.
          Moreover, the Magistrate’s responsibility to
          record the statement and the enquiry about the
          torture and provision for subsequent medical
          treatment makes the provision safer. It will
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010        -118-</span>




          deter the police officers from obtaining a
          confession from an accused by subjecting him to
          torture. It is also worthwhile to note that an
          officer   who   is   below    the    rank   of   a
          Superintendent of Police cannot record the
          confessional   statement.   It    is   a   settled
          position that if a confession was forcibly
          extracted, it is a nullity in law. Non-
          inclusion of this obvious and settled principle
          does not make the Section invalid. (See: Kartar
          Singh case, p. 678, para 248 –49 of SCC).
          Ultimately, it is for the Court concerned to
          decide the admissibility of the confession
          statement. (See: Kartar Singh case p. 683, para
          264 of SCC). Judicial wisdom will surely
          prevail over irregularity, if any, in the
          process of recording confessional statement.
          Therefore we are satisfied that the safeguards
          provided by the Act and under the law are
          adequate in the given circumstances and we
          don’t think it is necessary to look more into
          this   matter.   Consequently   we    uphold   the
          validity of <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_183">Section 32</a>.”
                             (emphasis laid by this Court)




</p><p id="p_235">     79. The provisions of a <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_184">Special Act</a> prevail over the

     provisions of <a href="/doc/143594/" id="a_185">General Act</a>. Since the constitutionality

     of the POTA was declared as valid by this Court, its

     provisions     would     prevail      over   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_186">CrPC</a>.   However,

     and the grave consequences that misuse of the Act

     might    carry    i.e,    violation           of       right    to    life    and

     personal       liberty,        we    need         to     ensure      that     the

     guidelines       laid    down        in     the        Act   are     rigorously

     observed while recording the confessional statements

     of the accused persons. We will examine herein the

     various    mandatory      provisions              to    be   followed       while

     recording the confessional statements and whether the

     same have been followed in the instant case.

     bound     to    make    confessional              statements         and    their

     as evidence and also the fact that the accused after

     fully knowing the consequences has decided to make the

     confessional statement. The relevant paragraphs of the

     judgment can be read as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">           “16. The constitutional validity of Section 15
           of the TADA Act was challenged. A Constitution
           Bench of this Court in Kartar Singh v. State of
           Punjab upheld the constitutional validity of
           the said provision. The contention urged in
           Kartar Singh case was that the procedure in the
           TADA Act is the antithesis of a just, fair and
           reasonable procedure and this power could be
           abused to extort confession by unlawful means
           by using third-degree methods. This plea was
           rejected   on   the  ground   that   sufficient
           safeguards have been made in the Rules as to
           the manner in which the confession is to be
           recorded. Rule 15 extracted above would show
           that confession shall be in writing and signed
           by the person who makes the confession. The
           police officer shall also certify under his own
           hand that such confession was taken in his
           presence and recorded by him and that the
           record contains a full and true account of the
           confession made by the person and such police

          officer shall make a memorandum at the end of
          the confession and the pro forma of such
          certificate also is appended to Rule 15.

          certificate having been given by PW 34. It is
          true that PW 34 had put certain questions to
          the accused as to whether he was aware that the
          statement which he wants to make could be used
          against him and on the basis of the same he
          will be sentenced. The officer also asked him
          whether there is any pressure, fear on him and
          he answered in the negative. However, PW 34 did
          not give the certificate at the end of the
          confession.     The   certificate     should   have
          specifically stated that he had explained to
          the person making the confession that he was
          not bound to make the confession and, if he
          does so, the confession he may make may be used
          against him and that he believed that this
          confession was voluntarily made and it was
          taken in his presence and recorded by him and
          was read over to the person making it and
          admitted by him to be correct, and it contained
          a full and true account of the statement made
          by him.

          deprecated the practice of non-observance of
          this provision and held that such violation
          would be inadmissible. In Bharatbhai v. State
          of Gujarat this Court held that Rule 15(3)(b)
          of the TADA Rules was not complied with and no
          memorandum as required was made. There was also
          no    contemporaneous    record    to    show   the
          satisfaction of the recording officer after
          writing of confession that the confession was
          voluntarily made or read over to the accused.
          Thus,     the     confessional    statement     was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_167">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010          -125-</span>




           inadmissible and cannot be made the basis for
           upholding the conviction.</blockquote>

           the accused was explained that he was not bound
           to make a confession and that if he made it, it
           could be used against him as evidence; that the
           confession was voluntary and that it was taken
           down by the police officer fully and correctly
           are all matters not left to be proved by oral
           evidence.”



     Though the case mentioned supra dealt with TADA, the

     Rules of which cannot be imported into POTA, the main

     objective behind mentioning this case was that the

     underlying safeguards which were required to be taken

     while    making     confessional   statement   to   the   police

     cannot be compromised with.

<p id="p_238">     82. The intimation letters of caution written by PW-78

     fail to prove that the process of intimation preceded

     continuous process. On the other hand, the letters of

     intimation and the confessional statements exist as

     was deferred on the ground that he shall be sent to

     judicial custody after the confession was made before

     the    CJM     and    this   would      hinder    the   investigation

     procedure. However, in the present case, presenting

<p id="p_242">     84. Now, we proceed to examine the statement of PW-78,

     DCP Mr. Sanjaykumar Gadhvi(Ex.452), who recorded the

     confessional    statements    of   the   accused   persons.    On

     being cross examined by the learned counsel for A-1,

     A-3 and A-5, he stated as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">          “..I have not asked the accused about since how
          many days they were in custody. I had asked to
          the officer who had brought the accused about
          since how many days the accused was in police
          custody. I had asked him but I don’t remember
          presently what reply was given by him. Before
          taking the statement of the accused persons, I
          did not examine their physical condition by

          removing their clothes. I knew that the fact
          that the accused persons were brought from the
          custody of Crime Branch. I had not asked to the
          accused persons before recording confessional
          statement that since how many days they were in
          custody   prior  to   the   recording  of   the
          confessional statement. I had not informed the
          accused persons that if they do not give
          confessional statement they will not be sent
          back to the Crime Branch custody. I have not
          made any note with regards to the fact that I
          had sent back the Crime Branch Officer along
          with vehicle. It is true that I had also not
          written the fact at any place with regards to
          the instruction given by me to return after
          around three hours and only when called by me.
          I had also not made any note with regards to
          the fact that I had got the accused persons
          seated in my P.A.s room. The fact that I had
          informed accused persons in writing that they
          are not bound to make statement and if they
          make then the same can be used against them,
          with regard to the said fact, I have not kept
          any copy with me. On asking me about how I had
          reached to the conclusion as stated by me with
          regards to the language of Mohammad Salim, I
          state that that he was speaking fearlessly and
          whatever facts were stated by him, its point
          were clear. There was no sign of fear in his
          expression and he was not crying. I have not
          made any note at any place with regards to the
          fact stated by me to the accused persons that
          their case is with Crime Branch and I am not
          associated with Crime Branch in any way. I have
          also not made note about having stated to the
          accused that I am Deputy Superintendent of
          different area. It is true that I have not
          noted the fact separately regarding which I

          purpose that he can re-think about giving
          statement voluntarily, I had called my office
          boy and had got him seated in adjacent office
          of my PA and had asked to have water and think
          over with peaceful mind for 10-15 minutes and

          regret felt by him, and that he in fact desires
          to make his statement”. It is true that there
          is no note regarding the fact that I had read

     required to explain in writing to the accused that he

     is not bound to make confessional statement and once

     such statement is made, the same can be used against

     him. Further, it is imperative that the accused is

     assured that if he does not make the confessional

     statement, it will not jeopardize his well-being while

     in   police     custody    and     also    to     ensure    that    such

     statements are made before a competent police officer

     in a threat-free environment. The deposition of the

     police officer PW-78 who had recorded the confessional

     statements of the accused persons however, reflects

     otherwise. He admitted to the fact that he did not

     assure    the    accused     persons       that    not     making   the

     confessional statement will not put them in adverse

     position.

     given them 15 minutes as reflection period. We will

     examine this aspect of the matter herein.</blockquote><p id="p_245">

</p><p id="p_246">            It    is   pertinent     to   mention       here    that     the    two

     exhibits      referred     to    supra,      namely,      the    letter    of

     intimation and the statements of confession, in the

     case of each of the accused persons, are of the same

     day.    It    has   been    contended        by    the    learned       senior

     counsel of the accused persons that not enough time

     was given to them to reflect on the incident before

     making       confessional       statements.        They    were    given     a

     token amount of time i.e., 15 minutes to think and

     reflect and thereafter the recording of confessional

     statements began, which fact is on record as per the

     statement of PW-78, who recorded their confessional

     statements. While it has been laid down by this Court

     that the amount of time to be given for reflection

     before        confession        depends       on     the        facts      and

     circumstances of the case, it is imperative to bear in

     mind that in the present case, the accused persons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_177">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -134-</span>




        were    making   confessions   after   a   period   almost   11

        months after the incident. Hence, a mere period of 15

        minutes does not appear to be reasonable time for

        reflection on the incident of the attack and their

        involvement in the same. In this regard, we wish to

        mention the observation made by this Court on this

        issue. In the case of State of Rajasthan v. Ajit Singh

        &amp; Ors.45, this Court observed as follows:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">               “12. We have perused the confession of the
               seven accused and the prefatory proceedings
               relating   thereto.   We  first   examine   the
               confession made by Noordeen. From Ext. P-18,
               the note recorded by Shri Ranjit Basot as a
               prelude to the recording of the confession, it
               transpires that he had been produced before him
               at 12.30 p.m. on 21-9-1991 and after the
               completion of the formalities the recording of
               the confession had started at 12.45 p.m.
               Likewise Ajit Singh alias Guru Lal Singh had
               been produced before the officer at 10.50 a.m.
               and the recording of the confession had started
               half an hour later. We have seen the record of
               confessions of the other accused as well and it
               shows that 15 to 30 minutes’ time was given to
               the accused for reflection before the actual


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_178">45</span>
     (2008) 1 SCC 601
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_179">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010      -135-</span>




          confessions were recorded. We accordingly find
          that sufficient cooling-off time had not been
          given to the accused, in the background that
          they had been in police custody over a long
          period of time. It has been held in Ranjit
          Singh case: (SCC pp. 76-77, paras 10-12)

            “10. According to the deposition of PW 3
            in cross-examination, the accused were in
            police   custody    18-20    days   prior   to
            recording      of      their      confessional
            statements. PW 3 has deposed that he gave
            the requisite warning to the accused that
            they   were    not    bound    to   make   the
            confessional statement and if they make it
            will be used as evidence against them, but
            despite the warning they were prepared and
            willing to make the statement. After
            recording the introductory statement in
            this behalf in question-answer form he
            still considered it proper to give them
            some time for rethinking and for this
            purpose they were allowed to sit in a
            separate room for some time and were
            brought to him after about half an hour
            and   expressed    their    desire   to   make
            statement and thereafter the confessional
            statements were recorded.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">            11. Before adverting to the facts said to
            have been narrated by the accused as
            recorded    in     the    two     confessional
            statements, it deserves to be noticed that
            in case the recording officer of the
            confessional statement on administering
            the statutory warning to the accused forms
            a belief that the accused should be
            granted some time to think over the

            matter, it becomes obligatory on him to
            grant reasonable time for the purpose to
            the accused. In other words, the cooling
            time that is granted has to be reasonable.
            What time should be granted would of
            course   depend    upon    the     facts   and
            circumstances of each case. At the same
            time, however, when the time to think over
            is granted that cannot be a mere farce for
            the sake of granting time. In a given
            case, depending on facts, the recording
            officer without granting any time may
            straight   away   proceed    to   record   the
            confessional statement but if he thinks it
            appropriate to grant time, it cannot be a
            mechanical   exercise    for    completing   a
            formality.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">            12. In Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh v. State
            of Punjab where a Magistrate granted about
            half an hour to the accused to think over
            and    soon    thereafter     recorded     the
            confessional     statement,      this    Court
            reiterated   that    when   an    accused   is
            produced before the Magistrate by the
            investigating officer, it is of utmost
            importance that the mind of the accused
            person should be completely freed from any
            possible influence of the police and the
            effective way of securing such freedom
            from fear to the accused person is to send
            him to jail custody and give him adequate
            time to consider whether he should make a
            confession at all. It would naturally be
            difficult to lay down any hard-and-fast
            rule as to the time which should be
            allowed to an accused person in any given

              facts of the present case, we are of the
              opinion that adequate time had not been given
              to any of the accused as they had been in
              police custody for almost 45 days in each case.
              We also observe that there is no evidence on
              record to suggest that the special report
              envisaged under sub-rule (5) of Rule 15 had
              been   submitted   to    the  Magistrate.   The

        Further,       in   the   case   of    Ranjit   Singh   v.   State   of

        Punjab46,which case is relied upon in the case of Ajit

        Singh(supra)        this Court observed as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">              “11. Before adverting to the facts to have been
              narrated by the accused as recorded in the two
              confessional statements, it deserves to be
              noticed that in case the recording officer of
              the confessional statement on administering the
              statutory warning to the accused forms a belief
              that the accused should be granted some time to
              think over the matter, it becomes obligatory on
              him to grant reasonable time for the purpose to
              the accused. In other words, the cooling time

          that is granted has to be reasonable. What time
          should be granted would of course depend upon
          the facts and circumstances of each case. At
          the same time, however, when the time to think
          over is granted that cannot be a mere farce for
          the sake of granting time. In a given case,
          depending on facts, the recording officer
          without granting any time may straightaway
          proceed to record the confessional statement
          but if he thinks it appropriate to grant time,
          it   cannot   be   a  mechanical  exercise   for
          completing a formality.
</blockquote><p id="p_249">          13.   This   Court   further  held:-   "However,
          speaking generally, it would, we think, be
          reasonable to insist upon giving an accused
          person at least 24 hours to decide whether or
          not he should make a confession. Where there
          may be reason to suspect that the accused has
          been persuaded or coerced to make a confession,
          even longer period may have to be given to him
          before his statement is recorded. In our
          opinion, in the circumstances of this case it
          is impossible to accept the view that enough
          time was given to the accused to think over the
          matter."
</p><p id="p_250">          20. In the facts and circumstances of the
          present case the grant of half an hour to the
          accused to think over before recording their
          confessional statement cannot be held to be a
          reasonable period. We do not think that is safe
          to   base   conviction   on  such   confessional
          statements. Further, on the facts of the
          present case, conviction cannot be maintained
          on the sole testimony of two police officials.
          It may also be noticed that although PW6
          Chander Bhan, Armourer, was examined by the
          prosecution to prove that the weapons were in
          working conditions, no effort was made to prove
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010              -139-</span>




            that the ammunition or the empties matched the
            weapons.”
                              (emphasis laid by this Court)

     Therefore, in the given facts and circumstances on

     record and based on the legal principles laid down by

     this Court, we are of the opinion that enough time was

     not    given    to   the    accused   persons       to    record   their

     confessional statements, particularly in the present

     case    since    they      were   making    confessions        after   11

     months of the incident.
</p>
<p id="p_251">     86. It is also pertinent to take note of the callous

     manner in which PW-99 had discharged his duty in the

     present      case.   Since    A-2   and     A-4    made   confessional

     statements on the same day, they were produced before

     the    CJM   PW-99   the     very   next    day.    It    is   pertinent

     From the above statements of the CJM PW-99, it can be

     inferred that he was able to record the statement of

     the accused persons, read it over to them and enquire

     about any coercion and torture, all in a period of

     half     an     hour.       It   is    highly    improbable       that    a

     confessional statement running to more than 15 pages

     could be read back to them within half an hour. The

     statement of PW-99 on examination in chief and also on

     cross examination has been mentioned above and it is

     clear     that    he    did      not    enquire     about    the     basic

     compliances he was required to make himself aware of,

     to     ensure    fair       investigation       against     the    accused

     persons. His conduct in recording of statement under

     <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_196">Section       32(5)</a>    of    POTA     merely    resembles    that    of   a

     passive reluctant officer involved in some procedural

     formality.
</p>
<p id="p_256">     87. It is pertinent to note here that while POTA makes

     a departure from <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_197">CrPC</a> in that it makes confessional

     statements made before a police officer admissible,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_187">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -142-</span>




     the procedural safeguards therein are not a mechanical

     formality. On the other hand, it should be able to

     inspire confidence to show that the procedure has been

     scrupulously    followed        while     recording      confessional

     statements     particularly           because     of     the      grave

     consequences which follow such statements, which might

     result in deprivation of life and personal liberty of

     the person, which is a fundamental right guaranteed by

     the   Constitution     that     can     be   taken     away    only    by

     following the procedure established by law. Therefore,

     it    is   incumbent     upon     the     CJM   to     strictly       and

     scrupulously    follow     all     the       statutory     procedural

     safeguards provided for under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_198">Section 32</a> of POTA.

</p><p id="p_257">     88. Further, the other statutory mandate under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_199">Section

     32</a> of POTA is that the person making the confessional

     statement shall be produced for medical examination

     and thereafter, be sent to judicial custody after the

     CJM records the statement of the accused person. The

     question which then arises for our consideration is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_188">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010              -143-</span>




     whether this mandate is operative only if the accused

     makes a complaint of torture before the CJM or whether

     the CJM is duty bound to send the accused persons to

     judicial    custody      as    a   statutory       requirement        after

     recording the statement. It had been contended by the

     learned    senior       counsel    on    behalf      of   the    accused

     persons that they were subjected to physical torture

     by the police before the confessional statements were

     recorded    and     that    they    were     also    kept   in    police

     custody     in    the      intervening       night     between        being

     produced before the CJM and being sent to Judicial

     Custody.      Therefore, though they were subjected to

     torture, they could not make a complaint before the

     CJM due to fear and apprehension, since they were

     taken back to police custody after their statements

     were    recorded.    The      learned   senior       counsel     for    the

     accused      persons,         argued        that      <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_200">Section         32(5)</a>

     unambiguously declares that the accused shall be sent

     to     judicial   custody       after       the    recording     of     the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_189">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                 -144-</span>




        confessional statements, whereas the learned senior

        counsel for the prosecution contended that the accused

        must be sent for medical examination only if there is

        a complaint of torture and only in that case, must he

        be sent to judicial custody. We are unable to agree

        with the argument of the learned senior counsel for

        the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_258">        Firstly, the use of the phrase, ‘shall be sent to

        judicial         custody’   after   confession        is   a   mandatory

        requirement in comparison to the use of an alternative

        term ‘may’ which gives discretionary power to the CJM.

        Further,     this     court   in    the   case   of    State    (NCT   of

        Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu47, has unambiguously observed

        as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">              “177. Now we look to the confession from
              other angles, especially from the point of
              view of in-built procedural safeguards in
              <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_201">Section 32</a> and the other safeguards contained
              in <a href="/doc/1361169/" id="a_202">Section 52</a>. It is contended by the learned

          senior counsel Mr. Gopal Subramanium that the
          DCP before recording the confession, gave the
          statutory warning and then recorded the
          confession at a place away from the police
          station,   gave    a   few   minutes   time    for
          reflection and only on being satisfied that
          the   accused    Afzal   volunteered     to   make
          confession in an atmosphere free from threat
          or inducement that he proceeded to record the
          confession    to   the   dictation    of    Afzal.
</blockquote><p id="p_259">          Therefore, it is submitted that there was
          perfect compliance with sub-Sections (2)&amp;(3).
          The next important step required by sub-
          Section (4) was also complied with inasmuch
          as Afzal was produced before the Additional
          Chief Metropolitan Magistrate-PW63 on the
          very next day i.e. 22.12.2001 along with the
          confessional statements kept in a sealed
          cover. The learned Magistrate opened the
          cover, perused the confessional statements,
          called the maker of confession into his
          chamber, on being identified by PW80-ACP and
          made it known to the maker that he was not
          legally bound to make the confession and on
          getting a positive response from him that he
          voluntarily made the confession without any
          threat or violence, the ACMM recorded the
          statement   to    that   effect   and    drew   up
          necessary proceedings vide Exts.PW63/5 and
          PW63/6. It is pointed out that the accused,
          having had the opportunity to protest or
          complain against the behavior of police in
          extracting the confession, did not say a
          single word denying the factum of making the
          confession      or     any     other      relevant
          circumstances impinging on the correctness of
          the confession. It is further pointed out
          that Afzal and the other accused were also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_192">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -146-</span>




          got medically examined by the police and the
          Doctor found no traces of physical violence.
          It is therefore submitted that the steps
          required to be taken under sub-Sections
          (4)&amp;(5) were taken. However, the learned
          counsel for the State could not dispute the
          fact that the accused Afzal was not sent to
          judicial custody thereafter, but, on the
          request of the I.O PW80, the ACMM sent back
          Afzal to police custody. Such remand was
          ordered   by   the   ACMM  pursuant   to   an
          application made by PW80 that the presence of
          Afzal in police custody was required for the
          purpose of further investigation. Thus, the
          last and latter part of sub-Section (5) of
          <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_203">Section 32</a> was undoubtedly breached. To get
          over this difficulty, the learned counsel for
          the State made two alternative submissions,
          both of which, in our view, cannot be
          sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_260">          178. Firstly, it was contended that on a
          proper construction of the entirety of sub-
          Section (5) of <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_204">Section 32</a>, the question of
          sending to judicial custody would arise only
          if there was any complaint of torture and the
          medical examination prima facie supporting
          such allegation. In other words, according to
          the    learned   counsel,    the   expression
          'thereafter'   shall   be    read   only   in
          conjunction with the latter part of sub-
          Section (5) beginning with 'and if there is
          any complaint' and not applicable to the
          earlier part. In our view, such a restrictive
          interpretation of sub-Section (5) is not at
          all warranted either on a plain or literal
          reading or by any other canon of construction
          including purposive construction. The other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_193">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -147-</span>




          argument raised by the learned counsel is
          that   the   provision    regarding    judicial
          custody, cannot be read to be a mandatory
          requirement so as to apply to all situations.
          If the Magistrate is satisfied that the
          confession   appears   to   have    been   made
          voluntarily and the person concerned was not
          subjected to any torture or intimidation, he
          need not direct judicial custody. Having
          regard to the circumstances of this case,
          there was nothing wrong in sending back Afzal
          to police custody. This contention cannot be
          sustained on deeper scrutiny.
</p>
<p id="p_261">          179. The clear words of the provision do not
          admit of an interpretation that the judicial
          custody should be ordered by the Chief
          Judicial Magistrate only when there is a
          complaint from the 'confession maker' and
          there appears to be unfair treatment of such
          person in custody. As already stated, the
          obligation to send the person whose alleged
          confession was recorded to judicial custody
          is a rule and the deviation could at best be
          in exceptional circumstances. In the present
          case, it does not appear that the ACMM (PW63)
          had in mind the requirement of <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_205">Section 32(5)</a>
          as to judicial custody. At any rate, the
          order passed by him on 22.12.2001 on the
          application filed by PW80 does not reflect
          his   awareness   of   such  requirement   or
          application of mind to the propriety of
          police remand in the face of <a href="/doc/1206663/" id="a_206">Section 32(5)</a> of
          POTA. Compelling circumstances to bypass the
          requirement of judicial custody are not
          apparent from the record.”

     lays down certain guidelines which are to be strictly

     adhered to while recording the confessional statements

     of an accused person under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_209">Section 32</a>. On this issue,

     it was held in Navjot Sandhu case (supra) as under:

          go    a  long   way   to   screen and   exclude
          confessions, which appear to be involuntary.
          The requirements and safeguards laid down in
          sub-sections (2) to (5) are an integral part of
          the scheme providing for admissibility of
          confession made to the police officer. The

          speaking through Krishna Iyer, J. in Nandini

          <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_217">Article 20(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1110422/" id="a_218">Section 161(2)</a> CrPC is

          Criminal Procedure Code is a parliamentary
          gloss on the constitutional clause” — it was
          observed (SCC p. 434, para 21). This Court
          rejected the contention advanced on behalf of
          the State that the two provisions, namely,
          <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_220">Article 20(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_221">Section 161</a>, did not operate
          at the anterior stages before the case came to
          Court and the incriminating utterance of the
          accused, previously recorded, was attempted to
          be   introduced.   Noting   that   the   landmark
          decision in Miranda v. Arizona did extend the
          embargo to police investigation also, the Court
          observed that there was no warrant to truncate
          the    constitutional    protection    underlying
          <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_222">Article 20(3).</a> It was held that even the
          investigation at the police level is embraced
          by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_223">Article 20(3)</a> and this is what precisely
          <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_224">Section 161(2)</a> means. The interpretation so

             self-incrimination, to police examination
             and custodial interrogation and takes in

     admissible in law in the present case. Therefore, we

     answer this point in favour of the appellants. We have

        However,       one   needs    to   understand    the   extent    of

        admissibility of such evidence. But prior to that, we

        also need to emphasize upon the reliability of the

        evidence given by an accomplice. It has been held by

        this court in the case of Haroom Haji Abdulla v. State

        of Maharashtra48 as under:
</p>
<p id="p_268">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">              “8. ...... <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_231">The Evidence Act</a> in <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_232">Section 133</a>
              provides that an accomplice is a competent
              witness against an accused person and that a
              conviction is not illegal merely because it
              proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of
              an accomplice. The effect of this provision is
              that the court trying an accused may legally
              convict him on the single evidence, of an
              accomplice. To this there is a rider in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_199">48</span>
     AIR 1968 SC 832
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_200">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -153-</span>




          Illustration (b) to <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_233">Section 114</a> of the Act
          which provides that the Court may presume that
          an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he
          is corroborated in material particulars. This
          cautionary provision incorporates a rule of
          prudence because an accomplice, who betrays his
          associates, is not a fair witness and it is
          possible   that   he   may,   to   please   the
          prosecution, weave false details into those
          which are true and his whole story appearing
          true, there may be no means at hand to sever
          the false from that which is true. It is for
          this reason that courts, before they act on
          accomplice evidence, insist on corroboration in
          material respects as to the offence itself and
          also implicating in some satisfactory way,
          however small, each accused named by the
          accomplice. In this way the commission of the
          offence is confirmed by some competent evidence
          other than the single or unconfirmed testimony
          of the accomplice and the inclusion by the
          accomplice of an innocent person is defeated.
</blockquote><p id="p_269">          This rule of caution or prudence has become so
          ingrained in the consideration of accomplice
          evidence as to have almost the standing of a
          rule of law.
</p><p id="p_270">          9. The argument here is that the cautionary
          rule applies, whether there be one accomplice
          or more and that the confessing co-accused
          cannot be placed higher than an accomplice.
          Therefore, unless there is some evidence
          besides these implicating the accused in some
          material respect, conviction cannot stand.
          Reliance is placed in this connection upon the
          observations of the Judicial Committee in
          Bhuboni Sahu v. Emperor a case in which a
          conviction was founded upon the evidence of an
          accomplice supported only by the confession of

              an opportunity of previous concert, might

              nevertheless observe that Courts should be
              slow to depart from the rule of prudence,
              based on long experience, which requires
              some independent evidence implicating the
              particular accused. The danger of acting
              upon accomplice evidence is not merely
              that   the    accomplice    is  on    his   own
              admission a man of bad character who took
              part in the offence and afterwards to save
              himself betrayed his former associates,
              and how has placed himself in a position
              in which he can hardly fail to have a
              strong bias in favour of the prosecution;
              the real danger is that he is telling a
              story which in its general outline is
              true, and it is easy for him to work into
              the story matter which is untrue....."

          place, among them one was named as Faradullah
          Ghauri alais Abu Sufiyan and Saukatullah
          Ghauri who was brother of Abu Sufiyan. They
          had said their speech before us that this
          much has happened in your Gujarat, despite
          this you do not awake from your sleep and you
          are engaged in playing carom. We are from

          Lashkar-e-Toiba is   having huge fund but is
          not having network and Jaish-e-Mohammed does
          not have fund but is having manpower as well
          as it is having network, and hence, both
          these groups will work together, therefore
          you just give donation. On that night many
          persons gave donation, donation of about 12
          to 13 thousand Riyals was given. We were
          taken to the program by Rashidbhai Ajmeri and
          Salimbhai because we did not know those
          people. Those people were new for us. Similar
          program was also organized after riots in
          Gujarat. At that time at least 400 people had
          gathered and all were from Gujarat. Good
          amount of donation was gathered in it also.
          …And thus by doing such small meetings, they
          used to gather money. After some time, people
          got fed up and used to say that you are not
          doing anything and are just utilizing the
          money. We used to give money to Salimbhai
          Sheikh who was with us, and he used to give
          this money to Faradullah Ghauri, and he used
          to send this money to India through charge
          responsibility (Hawala). He used to send this

          Thereafter, during about three months of
          riots post- Godhra in 2002, Faradullah Ghauri
          and Shaukatullah Maulana came to India, these
          people had visited the relief camps in
          Ahmedabad, and they had met with a person
          named Jahid in camp, and they had gathered

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">          “Question: Was Salimbhai your leader?
          Answer: Salimbhai had more responsibilities. He
          had more worries about Islam. When I met with
          Salimbhai on first Thursday after Godhra
          carnage, he had no cassette at that time. I had
          not kept any note for Salimbhai coming and
          going to India. At the time of Godhra carnage,
          Salimbhai was present at Saudi Arabia, and I

          not in Saudi Arabia?

<blockquote id="blockquote_75">          Answer: It is true that he was not present in

          voluntarily states that he was present at Saudi
          at the time of Akshardham.

<blockquote id="blockquote_78">          Answer: We used to give money to Salimbhai and
          we had not asked him about what he did with
          money nor did he say to us about what he did
          with the money.

          all other used to ask Salimbhai about what he
          did with the money. Salimbhai used to say that
          this money has been collected for taking
          revenge. Since he didn’t say anything everybody
          had stopped giving money. I don’t know if this

          said you will have to come and therefore we had
          attended two or three meetings. It was not like

          Maulvi Abdullah near the hall. I had said to
          them about what Adam had said, and in a way as
          if they already knew about it. Thereby, they
          replied that we know it and had assigned me the
          responsibility of arranging house for the
          guests who would come for the work of this
          carnage, and I had agreed…..

          place at Saudi Arabia, and he having informed
          that phone call will come at Doman Nasir’s
          place, Mufti Ayub and Maulvi had asked to four
          of us to go and discuss at Nasir’s home. But
          phone did not come. Thereafter, we and Adambhai
          had departed after deciding to talk to Saudi

          After two to three days, I and Adam had gone
          to Kalupur Darwaja on my scooter, and Nasir
          Doman had also come along on his scooter. From
          STD/ ISD booth named Kohinoor Telecom, Adam had
          dialed number at Saudi Arabia and firstly he
          had done all the talk in Arabic language, and
          thereafter to give us assurance, he had talked
          in Hindi language and asked to exchange
          greetings with the people involved with me in

          work. By saying this, Adam handed over the
          receiver to me……. I was asked from the other
          side in Gujarati, ‘brother, what you need,’.
          Prior to this, Adam had asked me to demand for
          Rs. 20 Lac for the work. Therefore, on my say
          that it would take Rs. 20 lac for the work, I
          was asked from the other side to give the phone
          to Adambhai. And Adam had done some talk in
          Arabic language. We could not understand the
          said language. …
          In the last week of May 2002, Nashir had called
          me to his house by sending message through
          someone. And when I went, Nashir, Adam and
          Adam’s brother Ahmed was present. Adam had
          given me Rs. 5000/- and had said to me that
          guests are going to come and you have to
          arrange for their lodging. And he had also
          given Rs.5000/- to Nashir and he said to buy
          two mobile phones from it and give it to
          Rehman, and had said that the numbers for the
          same will be given to the guests and had said
          that thereby they will remain in contact. At
          that time, I had said to Adam that another Rs.
          15,000/- will be required for deposit of house
          and for mattresses. So Adam said that it will
          also be arranged, and when it was informed to
          Mufti Qaiyum and Maulvi Abdullah at Bawahir
          Hall about all this, at that time Mufti Qaiyum
          had said to me that arrangement for lodging of
          guests should be done, money is arranged or
          not. At that time, Maulvi Abdullah had said
          that if there is much problem then he should be
          informed. After, one week, Nashir had given two
          mobile phones to me….. After taking the said
          phone, I had given it to Mehmood Wadhwani, and
          I had said to him that you should only switch

          had called me on my mobile phone …… We had cold
          drinks over there and he had given me Rs.
          5000/-. At that time, I had asked for another
          Rs. 10,000/- for house and arrangement as the
          earlier Rs. 5000/- had got spent in rickshaw
          fare and SIM card. Therefore, Adam had agreed
          for arranging another Rs. 10,000/- and thereby
          we had departed. Thereafter, Nashir Doman had
          come to call me at Hall and had said to me that
          Adam is presently sitting at his brother,
          Ahmed’s house and is calling you. Thereafter, I
          and Nashir both went to Ahmed’s house by
          walking and Adam had given me Rs. 10,000/- and
          had informed me that guests will come from
          Hyderabad to do carnage in Gujarat, and had
          asked me to do arrangement for house and other
          arrangements speedily, and therefore, I had
          agreed and thereby we had departed.
          …..And Adam had informed that the guests will
          arrive from Hyderabad in one or two weeks. But
          nobody had arrived. During June 2002, Adam had
          said to me that your mobile phone for contact
          is switched off. Therefore, the guests arriving
          from Hyderabad while arriving at Ahmedabad had
          contacted from Kheda, but since mobile phone
          was switched off, contact could not be made and
          thus, it seems that they have returned. …. I
          had informed him that if the phone is switched
          off, I will get it switched on. ..
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_86">          I felt that Adam must have assured about the
          other phone given to me if it is switched off
          or switched on. And since the phone was
          continuously switched off, he has made story
          about the guests having returned from Kheda,
          just to reprimand me. But I did not come to

          know if the guests may have come up to Kheda or
          not. After about a week or 10 days, Adam met me
          at Dariapur and had said to me that the carnage
          persons have returned back after coming to
          Bareja- Narole as contact could not be made.
          Therefore, there is no meaning keeping the
          mobile phone with you. By having said this, he
          has asked us to return both the mobile phones,
          and therefore I had replied that there is my
          card inserted in the mobile phone with me and I
          will return it to you after I get another
          instrument for me, and I will return the other
          one by getting it back from my friend, so Adam
          had said to give both the mobile phones to
          Nashir and thereby he had left…..
          During this time, Liyakat of Juhapura who had
          gone outstation for marriage ceremony had
          returned, and he met me at the corner of Madhno
          Mohallo at Dariapur. He had said to me that now
          the guests are not going to come. Possession of
          the said house is to be handed back to
          Sohrabkhan after returning mattresses, barrels
          and table fans. The rent for it is to be paid
          by me. After informing this, three or four days
          later, Liyakat had said to me at Madhno Mohallo
          that everything has been returned and Sohrab
          had said about Rs. 500/- with regard to the
          rent. Therefore, I had     given Rs. 500/- to
          Liyakat. …
          Adam used to come every week for collecting the
          money because he had given me Rs. 20,000/- and
          two mobile phones for making arrangements for
          the person to coming from Hyderabad to do
          carnage, and from among them, one mobile phone
          was taken back through Nashir and one was with
          me and therefore, he used to ask for it. I used
          to give him Rs. 300/- to Rs. 500/-. At last,
          during end of September, once Adam had come to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_212">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -165-</span>




          my shop during noon time and had said that the
          guest who were to come from      Hyderabad for
          doing carnage have arrived. He said, “I have to
          take them around the city and therefore, I am
          in need of more money”. At that time, Adam had
          asked for Rs. 2000/- from me, but since the
          said was not with me, I was asked to meet at
          night, because I had to pay the due amount.
          Adam had come in the night and since I had
          arrangement for Rs. 900/-, I had given Rs.</blockquote><p id="p_280">
</p><p id="p_281">          900/- to him. At that time Adam had also said
          to me that I had received the guests coming
          from Hyderabad at Railway station, who have
          come to do carnage and have taken them around
          the city and thereafter have dropped them at
          the railway station. During those days, while I
          was passing from opposite of Dariapur Bawahir
          Hall, at that time Mufti Abdul Qaiyum and
          Maulvi   Abdullah   had   met   and    exchanged
          greetings. He had asked for well being and at
          that time Mufti Abdul Qaiyum had informed me
          that “the persons who were to come for carnage,
          those guests have arrived, and God willing,
          victory will be ours in short time”. Some days
          earlier I had dispute with Maulvi Abdullah and
          Mufti regarding dissimilarity of dowry in the
          marriage of refugee girls in camp and since
          there was no arrangement for distribution of
          sewing machines. Therefore, I had not given
          interest in their say. Thereafter, some days
          later, while I was sitting at my traders place
          at Gomaji complex, Pankornaka, Tran Darwaja, I
          got the news that terrorists have attacked
          Akshardham Temple. Therefore, I got the doubt
          that this work may have been done by the
          persons who have come from Hyderabad to do
          carnage. Because, these people have said to me
          the persons for carnage have arrived.”

     Finally, we are extracting the relevant excerpt from

     the statement made by PW-52 (Ex.315). The excerpt from

     his statement reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_87">          “When the relief camp for Muslims had started
          at Dariapur Bawahir Hall, at that time Muslim
          youths of our area used to gather over there.
          All used to sit and talk. Abdul Rehman Panara
          was the organizer of the camp. Since he had
          business by name of Panara Garments, I knew
          him. The main administrators of the camp were
          Mufti   Abdul  Qaiyum   and  Maulvi   Abdullah.
          Nasirbhai Doman who used to visit camp is cable
          operator of our area, and I know him. I know
          Adambhai since last election of Municipality
          because he used to take interest in politics by
          Congress Party. I knew brother of Adambhai
          named Ahmedbhai of Dariapur, and therefore, I
          started knowing Adambhai.

          called me on my mobile phone during noon time.
          I had gone to Chaarwad Bawahir Hall and Nasir,
          Adam and Abdul Rehman were present over there.
          At that time, Adam Bhai had said that Muslims
          have been oppressed here. And therefore,
          carnage for taking its revenge is to be done.
          He said that “my brother Rashid is in Saudi.
          And Salim is with him. They have support of

          Jaish-e-mohammad organization. We will seek
          money from there. Those people will send men
          and provide weapon. Salim has contact with
          Jaish-e-Mohammad and Tanzeem. He had said that
          these people are being sent for committing
          carnage (kand). On listening to this, I got up
          and felt afraid. When I got up, Adambhai had
          made me to sit by holding my hand and had
          stated that we will also have to take advice
          from big persons in this regard. Thereafter, we
          had met with Mufti Aiyub Qaiyum and Maulvi
          Abdullah at the office outside hall.
          Both of them had informed that guests will
          arrive for carnage. The work of arranging for
          their house has been assigned to Abdul Rehman.
          Adam had asked for a local phone number.
          Therefore, Doman Bhai had given his house
          telephone number. …
          On second time, I, Abdul Rehman, Nasir Doman,
          Adam had met in presence of Mufti Qaiyum and
          Abdullah at Bawahir Hall. At that time, Adam
          had informed that talk has been done at Saudi,
          and number of Doman’s house has been given.
          Therefore,   phone   will  come    over  there.
          Thereafter, Mufti Qaiyum and Maulvi Abdullah
          had asked to four of us to go and discuss at
          Nasir’s house, so that the phone call at
          Nasir’s can be attended to …. But since no call
          came, we had departed. Therefore, Rehman and
          Adam had gone on Rehman’s scooter to talk from
          PCO/   STD  at   railway  station.   And  after
          returning from Bawahir Hall, they had stated
          that after trying to Saudi, nobody was found
          present.

        on    merit,     we     need   to   satisfy    ourselves     that    the

        evidence of the accomplices is acceptable. The twin

        test on this point has been laid down by this Court in

        the    three     judge     bench    decision    of   this    Court    in

        Ravinder        Singh    v.    State    of    Haryana49     which    was

        reiterated in the case of Mrinal Das &amp; Ors. v. State

           a rare case taking into consideration all the
           factors, circumstances and situations governing

           confidently held to be true and reliable by the
           court may be permissible. Ordinarily, however,
           an approver's statement has to be corroborated
           in material particulars bridging closely the
           distance between the crime and the criminal.
           Certain   clinching   features   of    involvement
           disclosed by an approver appertaining directly
           to an accused, if reliable, by the touchstone
           of other independent credible evidence, would
           give the needed assurance for acceptance of his
           testimony on which a conviction may be based.”

                                 (emphasis laid by this Court)




     A perusal of the evidence of all the three accomplices

     in the present case shows that all of them intended to

     absolve themselves of the liability for the conspiracy

     with respect to the attack on Akshardham, going as far

     to mention that they were not involved in the incident

     and only the accused persons knew about the intricate

     details of the chain of events that ultimately led to

     the execution of their plan of ‘carnage’. Even then,

     if,    we   were   to   presume   that    the   accomplices   have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_221">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                        -172-</span>




        implicated        themselves         by    mentioning       that       they    were

        aware about some incident which was about to happen

        and thus, were part of the criminal conspiracy, the

        evidence of the accomplices fail the second test, in

        that    it      fails    to    prove       the      guilt   of    the       accused

        persons         beyond    reasonable             doubt.     All       the     three

        accomplices          mentioned       about       the     plan    of    ‘carnage’

        which     the        accused    persons            had   planned       together.

        However,        no    link     can    be      established         between       the

        accused persons and the attack on Akshardham since the

        evidence of the accomplices is far too vague and they

        fail    to      provide       any    form     of     substantive        evidence

        against the accused persons. Therefore, we need to

        examine the statements of the accomplices in the light

        of the legal principle laid down by this Court in the

        case    of      Mohd.     Husain          Umar     Kochra       Etc.    v.     K.S.

          “21. On the merits, we find that the two courts
          have recorded concurrent findings of fact.
          Normally this Court does not re-appraise the
          evidence unless the findings are perverse or
          are vitiated by any error of law or there is a
          grave miscarriage of justice. The courts below
          accepted the testimony of the accomplice Yusuf
          Merchant. <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_237">Section 133</a> of the Evidence Act says:
</p><p id="p_285">               “An accomplice shall be a competent
            witness against an accused person; and a
            conviction is not illegal merely because
            it    proceeds   upon   the   uncorroborated
            testimony of an accomplice.”
          Illustration (b) to <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_238">Section 114</a> says that the
          Court may presume that an accomplice is
          unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in
          material particulars. The combined effect of
          <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_239">Sections 133</a> and <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_240">114</a>, Illustration (b) is that
          though a conviction based upon accomplice
          evidence is legal the Court will not accept
          such evidence unless it is corroborated in
          material particulars. The corroboration must
          connect the accused with the crime. It may be
          direct or circumstantial. It is not necessary
          that the corroboration should confirm all the
          circumstances of the crime. It is sufficient if
          the corroboration is in material particulars.
          The corroboration must be from an independent
          source.   One   accomplice   cannot  corroborate
          another, see Bhiva Doulu Patil v. State of
          Maharashtra and R. v. Baskerville. In this
          light we shall examine the case of each
          appellant separately.”

     Therefore, in the light of the case mentioned above,

     we begin with examining in detail the evidence of PW-

</p><p id="p_286">     50. He has stated in his deposition about watching

     videos of riots and killing of Muslims in Gujarat in

     the house of A-3 at Riyadh, which act, by itself does

     not   constitute   a     criminal   offence.   On   being   asked

     during the cross examination before the Special Court

     (POTA) if the money donated by the gathering in Saudi

     Arabia to A-3, was used for running the relief camps

     in Gujarat, he was not able to answer for what purpose

     exactly the money was collected. Therefore, at the

     most, even if his evidence is taken to be true for the

     sake of argument, some suspicion, if at all, can be

     cast on the involvement of A-3 in some sort of illegal

     activity at the most. But culpability of a person in

     as grievous an offence as this, cannot be premised on

     mere suspicion without knowledge of the nature of the

     illegal activity.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_225">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010           -175-</span><p id="p_287">




</p><p id="p_288">     94. Next, with respect to PW-51, the evidence is not

     reliable because of two reasons. Firstly, according to

     his evidence, it was reported to him by A-2 that the

     fidayeens had arrived from Hyderabad which contradicts

     the claim of the prosecution. Secondly, A-2 did not

     state    anything   beyond      the    alleged      arrival    of     the

     fidayeens which cannot be connected to the event of

     attack     on   Akshardham   beyond      reasonable         doubt.     It

     again, merely arouses suspicion about the involvement

     of A-2 and the passive approval of A-4 and A-5 in the

     incident.
</p>
<p id="p_289">     Even with respect to PW-52, other than the fact that

     he   mentioned    about   A-2    telling     him     that    they     are

     planning    a   ‘carnage’    and      that   some    ‘guests’        have

     arrived, no other detail was provided by PW-52 in his

     evidence.       It is also pertinent to mention here that

     A-6 had not been mentioned at all in the evidence of

     any of the accomplices. Therefore, the twin test to

     establish the credibility of the guilt of the accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_226">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                    -176-</span>




        persons       based    on    the    evidence     of   the    accomplices,

        fails miserably in the present case.

</p><p id="p_290">              Further,        on    the    aspect   of   guilt      to   be   proved

        beyond reasonable doubt, it is pertinent to mention

        the case of Vijay Kumar Arora v. State(Govt. of NCT of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_227">                 52</span>
        Delhi)        , wherein the Court held as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">              “16.Essential ingredients to prove the guilt of
              an accused by circumstantial evidence   are:
              16.1. The law relating to circumstantial
              evidence is well settled. In dealing with
              circumstantial evidence, there is always a
              danger that conjecture or suspicion lingering
              on mind may take place of proof. Suspicion,
              however, strong cannot be allowed to take place
              of proof and, therefore, the Court has to be
              watchful and ensure that conjectures and
              suspicion do not take place of legal proof.
              However, it is no derogation of evidence to say
              that it is circumstantial. Human agency may be
              faulty in expressing picturisation of actual
              incident, but the circumstances cannot fail.
              Therefore, many a times it is aptly said that

          established. Each fact sought to be relied upon
          must be proved individually. However, in
          applying this principle, a distinction must be
          made between facts called primary or basic on
          the one hand and inference of facts to be drawn
          from them, on the other. In regard to proof of
          primary facts, the court has to judge the
          evidence and decide whether that evidence
          proves a particular fact and if that fact is
          proved, the question whether that fact leads to
          an inference of guilt of the accused person
          should be considered. In dealing with this
          aspect of the problem, the doctrine of benefit
          of doubt applies.”

                                (emphasis laid by this Court)



</p><p id="p_293">     95. Thus, as can be seen from the above mentioned

     case, the evidence of the accomplices at the most,

     raises suspicion and conjectures but the same cannot

     be construed as legal evidence against the accused

     persons,     relying     solely      on   which      they     can    be

     convicted,    as   has   been     done    by   the   courts    below.

     Moreover, it is a settled principle of law that the

     confessional    statements      of   accomplices      form    a     very

     weak form of evidence, to prove the culpability of the

     accused persons if the guilt of the accused cannot                    be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_230">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                   -178-</span>




        proved,        independent       of    the     statements      of    the

        accomplices. Therefore, the same cannot be used to

        corroborate the confessional statements of an accused.

        Instead,       there    should    be     independent     evidence     to

        corroborate       the     evidence       of     the   accomplice      to

        establish       the    culpability      of    the   accused.   In   this

        regard, we intend to rely upon the three Judge bench

        decision of this court as early as 1952 which still

        holds its field. In the case of Kashmira Singh v.

        State of Madhya Pradesh53, this court held as under:

             what way the confession of an accused person
             can be used against a co-accused? It is evident
             that it is not evidence in the ordinary sense

</p><p id="p_296">         Their Lordships also point out that it is
            "obviously     evidence    of    a    very     weak
            type...... It is a much weaker type of
            evidence than the evidence of an approver,
            which is not subject to any of those
            infirmities."
</p><p id="p_297">         ....
</p><p id="p_298">         10.    Translating     these     observations       into
         concrete terms they come to this. The proper
         way to approach a case of this kind is, first,
         to marshal the evidence against the accused
         excluding    the    confession     altogether       from
         consideration and see whether, if it is
         believed, a conviction could safely be based on
         it. If it is capable of belief independently of
         the confession, then of course it is not
         necessary to call the confession in aid. But
         cases may arise where the judge is not prepared
         to act on the other evidence as it stands even
         though, if believed, it would be sufficient to
         sustain a conviction. In such an event the
         judge may call in aid the confession and use it
         to lend assurance to the other evidence and
         thus fortify himself in believing what without
         the aid of the confession he would not be
         prepared to accept.
</p><p id="p_299">         11.   Then,     as   regards    its     use    in    the
         corroboration of accomplices and approvers. A
         co-accused    who    confesses    is    naturally     an
         accomplice    and    the   danger     of    using    the
         testimony of one accomplice to corroborate
         another has repeatedly been pointed out. The
         danger   is    in   no   way   lessened      when    the
         "evidence" is not on oath and cannot be tested
         by cross-examination. Prudence will dictate the
         same rule of caution in the case of a witness
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_233">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -180-</span>




         who though not an accomplice is regarded by the
         judge as having no greater probative value. But
         all these are only rules of prudence. So far as
         the law is concerned, a conviction can be based
         on   the    uncorroborated   testimony    of   an
         accomplice provided the judge has the rule of
         caution, which experience dictates, in mind and
         gives reasons why he thinks it would be safe in
         a given case to disregard it. Two of us had
         occasion to examine this recently in Rameshwar
         v. The State of Rajasthan,Cri. App. No.2 of
         1951 : (AIR 1952 SC 54). It follows that the
         testimony of an accomplice can in law be used
         to corroborate another though it ought not to
         be so used save in exceptional circumstances
         and for reasons disclosed. As the Privy Council
         observe in Bhuboni Sahu v. The King, 76 Ind.
         App. 147 at p.157 :
</p><p id="p_300">            "The tendency is include the innocent with
            the guilty is peculiarly prevalent in
            India, as judge have noted on innumerable
            occasions, and it is very difficult for
            the court to guard against the danger....
            The only real safeguard against the risk
            of condemning the innocent with the guilty
            lies in insisting on independent evidence
            which in some measure implicates such
            accused."
</p><p id="p_301">         12.………We do not doubt that a rickshaw was used
         because rickshaw tracks were discovered by the
         well long before anybody had suggested that a
         rickshaw had been used. But we find it
         difficult to resist the inference that this
         witness was an accomplice so far as the
         disposal    of    the   body    was    concerned.
</p><p id="p_302">         Consequently, he is in much the same category
         so far as credibility is concerned. That brings
         us at once to the rule that save in exceptional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_234">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010         -181-</span>




         circumstances one accomplice cannot be used to
         corroborate another; nor can he be used to
         corroborate   a  person   who   though  not   an
         accomplice is no more reliable than one. We
         have therefore either to seek corroboration of
         a kind which will implicate the appellant apart
         from the confession or find strong reasons for
         using Gurubachan's confession for that purpose.
         Of course against Gurubachan there is no
         difficulty, but against the appellant the
         position is not as easy.
</p><p id="p_303">         We will therefore examine the reliability of
         Gurubachan's confession against the appellant.
         Now there are some glaring irregularities
         regarding this confession and though it was
         safe for the Sessions Judge and the High Court
         to act on it as against Gurubachan because he
         adhered to it throughout the sessions trial
         despite his pleader's efforts to show the
         contrary, a very different position emerges
         when we come to the appellant.
</p><p id="p_304">         The first point which emerges regarding this is
         that the confession was not made till the 25-2-
         1950, that is to say, not until two months
         after the murder…”
                            (emphasis laid by this Court)


     In the present case, the prosecution did not make any

     effort to substantiate the evidence of the accomplices

     with   independent       material   evidence.   Rather,   the

     confessional statements of the accomplices have been

     used to corroborate the confessional statements of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_235">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010              -182-</span>




     accused persons, in the absence of any independent

     evidence.

<p id="p_305">     96.    But,    apart        from   all   these          aspects     on    the

     statements of the accomplices, we fear that the story

     against     the    accused     persons      and    its     corroboration

     through the statements of accomplices is an act of

     concoction to make up a case against them. It was

     recorded      in     the     statement      of     PW-126         that   the

     information regarding PW-50 was given to him by D.G.

     Vanzara.      However,      D.G.   Vanzara        had    not    even     been

     examined in this case and there is no information as

     to how he came to know about PW-50 after almost a year

     of    the   attack     on    Akshardham.     This        very     important

     aspect of the lapse in investigation had been ignored

     by the courts below. The learned senior counsel for

     the accused persons have contended that there has been

     a delay of around a year from the time of the attack

     on    Akshardham     in     recording    the      statements        of    the

     accomplices which shrouds the case of the prosecution.

       We have to accept the contention of the learned senior

       counsel for the accused persons in this regard as

       there    is   an   inordinate    delay   in   recording    of   the

       statements of the accomplices and this casts a grave

       suspicion on the reliability of the testimony of the

       accomplices.

     The    statement    made    by    PW-51        during   the    cross

     examination along with the legal principle laid down

     by this Court leads us to the conclusion that there

     was a serious attempt on the part of the investigating

     agency to fabricate a case against the accused persons

     and frame them with the help of the statements of the

     accomplices, since they had not been able to solve the

     case even after almost a year of the incidence.

     accomplices    cannot      be    used     to     corroborate       the

     confessional statements of the accused persons in the

     absence of independent evidence and the delay of more

     than one year in recording their statements causes us

     to disregard their evidence. Therefore, we answer this

     point in favour of the appellants.

     The learned senior counsel on behalf of the accused

     persons had expressed strong suspicion as to whether

     the letters produced before the court as Ex.658 were

     the same letters which were found from the pocket of

     the trousers of the fidayeens. While making the above

     contention, the learned senior counsel on behalf of

     the   accused      persons    placed       reliance      upon     the   FIR

     registered       under     <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_244">Section     154</a>     CrPC      by    PW-126   on

     25.09.2002       (Ex.680).    The     FIR    mentioned         about    the

     seizure     of    some     articles     from      the     body    of    the

     fidayeens which were mentioned in the list handed over

     by PW-91 to PW-126. It was imperative therefore, on

     the part of the prosecution to ensure that Brigadier

     Sitapati was required to be examined before the Court

     so as to prove that he signed on the letters marked as

     Ex.658 and they were the same letters recovered by

     Maj. Jaydeep Lamba (PW-91) from the bodies of the

     fidayeens.       Otherwise,    the    absence      of    such     evidence

     adversely        affects    the     case     of    the        prosecution.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_248">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -194-</span>




     However, the statement of PW-91 under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_245">Section 161</a> CrPC

     was not recorded. The necessary implication of this is

     that he could not have been presented as a chargesheet

     witness, as his evidence is recorded for the first

     time   before     the    Special      Court      (POTA).     and       his

     statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_246">Section 161</a> CrPC was not taken by the

     I.O.   However,    Brigadier      Sitapati,      who   is   the       most

     important    witness     for    proving    the    recovery       of    the

     alleged letters from the pockets of the trousers of

     the fidayeens, was not examined either under <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_247">Section

     161</a> or before the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_324">     99. It is a settled position of law in the criminal

     jurisprudence that a witness, whose evidence is placed

     reliance upon by the Court, has to be examined and

     questioned during the course of investigation by the

     police and his name has to appear in the chargesheet

     so   that   the   accused      gets   a   fair    chance    to     cross

     examine such witness. It was held in the case of Ram

<p id="p_325">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_114">            “37. It is true that no enmity or grudge is
            suggested against this witness, but we find
            that this witness was not even examined by the
            police nor was he cited in the chargesheet. In
            a grave charge like the present, it will not be
            proper to place reliance on a witness who never
            figured during the investigation and was not
            named in the chargesheet. The accused who are
            entitled to know his earlier version to the
            police are naturally deprived of an opportunity
            of effective cross-examination and it will be
            difficult to give any credence to a statement
            which was given for the first time in court
            after about a year of the occurrence. We
            cannot, therefore, agree that the High Court
            was right in accepting the evidence of this
            witness as lending assurance to the testimony
            of other witnesses on the basis of which alone
            perhaps the High Court felt unsafe to convict
            the accused.”



       The legal principle laid down by this Court in the

       aforementioned      case    renders        the     case     of   the

     translation of the documents from Gujarati language to

     English submitted by both the parties have majorly

     inconvenienced us. Therefore, instead of relying on

     either of the versions, particularly the aspect of the

     statement of the translator, since the same has been

     majorly   contested      before   us,     we   intend    to   closely

     consider the other relevant evidence on this aspect

     which is brought to our notice. The excerpts of the

     The contents of the letter nowhere mention the name of

                (translation extracted from the Additional
          documents submitted on behalf of the appellants)



     He also stated during the cross examination by the

     learned counsel for A-2 and A-4:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_137">          “I have not recorded any statement of Brig. Raj
          Sitapati during my investigation, nor have I

     If    the    statement     of     PW-105     is   taken       into

     consideration, it would mean that no signature was

     made on the back of the letters, and that the letters

     seized were not kept in sealed covers which increased

     the chance of letters being replaced subsequently. It

     is   also   on   record   that    the    photographer   and   the

     videographer who had recorded the scene of offence as

     per the instruction of PW-126 had not been examined.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_138">     102. Further, the post mortem report of the fidayeens

     (Ex.492) stated that all their clothes were stained

     with blood and mud            and all clothes bore multiple

     tears and holes due to perforation by bullets.                      In

     such a case, the fact that the letters remained clean,

     without any tear, soiling or stains of blood and soil

     is highly unnatural and improbable.

<p id="p_334">     103. Therefore, we cannot accept the recording of the

     High   Court   that    the    secret      behind   the    crease-free

     unsoiled    and     unstained    letter     lies     in   the   divine

     philosophy of “Truth is stranger than fiction” for

     this renowned epithet by the author Mark Twain comes

     with   a   caveat    that    says,     “Truth   is    stranger    than

     fiction.    Fiction    must     make    sense”.      We   accordingly

     accept the contentions of the learned senior counsel

     on behalf of the accused persons and hold that the two

     letters marked as Ex. 658 cannot be taken as evidence

     in order to implicate the accused persons in this

     crime. Hence, we answer this point in favour of the

     appellants.

</p><p id="p_336">     104.    The   learned    senior   counsel      on   behalf   of   the

            come here at the time of noon’s prayer here, at
            that time I and both fidayins will have to go

          and for their prayer we all five persons
          performed two rakat nafal namaz and gave hug to
          each other. At that time Maulvi Abdullah had
          given one chit each to the fidayin written by
          me in Urdu yesterday as per my instruction and
          if in future chits are caught to show that

     Therefore, by placing reliance upon the confessional

     letters mentioned above and the opinion of the hand

     writing expert,Jagdish Bhai(PW-89) the learned counsel

     on   behalf    of    the   prosecution     contended   that     the

     alleged letters had been written by A-4.

     not recorded. We have to accept this contention as the

     investigating officers have conveniently omitted to

     record the statements of witnesses which could have

     established beyond reasonable doubt that the letters

     were the same ones as discovered from the site of

     his confessional statement whereas the opinions of the

     hand writing experts are merely indicative and not

     conclusive beyond reasonable doubt. We begin with the

     comment made by the translator of the Urdu letters

     (PW-121: Ex.657) who had categorically stated that:

     But   considering      the   fact    that     he    was   not   a    hand

     evidence of the hand writing expert, Jagdish Bhai (PW-

     Further, he was asked, if the person who analyses such

     a   document   can   read   or    write   the   language     of   the

     The hand writing expert had stated that he cannot read

     or write the Urdu language. He can read Urdu language

     only with the aid of a book.

<blockquote id="blockquote_148">     106. We state that considering the seriousness of this

     case and the gravity of the offences, it was the duty

     of the handwriting expert to seek opinion of other

     experts which he claimed to have done. PW-89 stated

     that he requested the Director of FSL to seek the

     service of the Central Government Laboratory, and the

     photocopies    of   the   documents    were   sent    to   the

     Government Examiner of Questioned Documents(in short

     ‘GEQD’), Ministry of Home Affairs, Hyderabad for the

     preliminary     examination.      Accordingly,       Assistant

     Government Examiner, Shri A.K Singh and Shri R.K Jain,

     the senior most GEQD of the Central government had

     arrived at the FSL of Gujarat. It was further stated

     by PW-89 that the officers from Hyderabad had worked

     independently and prepared their opinion. Accordingly,

     PW-89 formed a final opinion based upon the opinion of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_268">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010             -213-</span>




     the    aforesaid     officers      (Ex.511).      The    senior     most

     officer, Mr. R.K Jain, sent certificate via fax on

     14.09.2003      in   which   he   had    stated   that    he   was    in

     consent with the opinion of PW-89. However, objection

     was raised by the counsel for the accused persons at

     the Special Court (POTA) for taking this certificate

     on    record,   since    this     document   of    certificate       was

     never given to the defence in the chargesheet papers,

     or at any time thereafter. Moreover, the prosecution

     had also submitted that even they were unaware of the

     existence of this document, and this knowledge had

     come before them only during the course of recording

     of the deposition of PW-89 before the Special Court

     (POTA). Therefore, the certificate was taken on record

     with the objection of the defence.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_348">     107. After perusing the above mentioned evidence on

     record, we decipher that the prosecution had contended

     that the Urdu letters (Ex.658) were written by A-4 by

     only    placing      reliance     upon     the    opinion      of    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_269">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -214-</span>




     handwriting expert, PW-89. However, the certificate of

     the   seniormost     official     of   FSL,     Hyderabad     was   not

     admitted on record till a much later stage, after the

     charge sheet was prepared and PW-89 gave his statement

     before    the    court.    It   was    at    this   stage    that   his

     evidence was admitted with protest from the defence.

     PW-89 in his evidence had stated that he has basic

     knowledge   of     Urdu   and   cannot      differentiate      between

     Urdu, Arabic and Persian. He further stated that the

     opinion    of    handwriting     experts      is    not    conclusive.

     Therefore, we hold that the prosecution had failed to

     establish       beyond    reasonable        doubt   that    the     Urdu

     letters (Ex.658) were written by A-4. Accordingly, we

     answer this point in favour of the appellants.

     123 that firstly, A-6 is not the owner of the car

     since it was registered in the name of some other

     person as per the report of R.T.O (Ex.672). Secondly,

     as per the Order of the CJM of Budgam, Jammu and

     Kashmir   (Ex.674)   dated   11.10.2003,   A-6   was    not   in

     used for carrying weapons for the attack on Akshardham

     whereas he was actually found in possession of another

     car   bearing   Registration    no.    CHOIX-3486.     Finally,

     though a panchnama was drawn up of the alleged car, by

     the police of Jammu and Kashmir, it was for them to

     hand over the car from their custody to the Gujarat

     had been produced before us to show that the car was

     recovered from the         workshop/ garage of A-6 or even

     that   the    garage/    workshop      from       which    the   car   was

     allegedly      recovered   belongs      to    A-6.        Therefore,   we

     cannot see how the car can be linked to A-6 in the

     absence of any independent evidence other than his

     retracted.

     Crime Branch, Ahmedabad regarding the seizure of the

     car since it is reflective of how casually and with

     what impunity the investigation has been conducted in

     the instant case by the investigating officer. PW-125,

     who was a part of the investigation of this case in

     Kashmir, and who was also responsible for escorting A-

          panchnama regarding seizure of car no. KMT- 413

          confiscated, its panchnama is made, that
          panchnama should be obtained while seizing car
          in another crime. As I was engaged in other
          work, I did not get panchnama. It is not true
          that panchnama of Cr. No. 130/ 2003 was not

     made during its alleged seizure in case no. 130 of

     2003 was seen by PW-125 since, “he was engaged in

     other work”. However, without verifying the contents

     of the panchnama and the seizure memo of the car in

     Case No.130 of 2003, the involvement of the car had

     been admitted in evidence on record by the courts

     below, merely on the basis of the subsequent panchnama

     drawn by the Gujarat police, which was only for the

     transfer of possession of the car from the police of

     Jammu and Kashmir to the Gujarat police.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_156">           In light of the evidence mentioned above, we are

     not inclined to give any weightage to the panchnama

     drawn by the Gujarat police at Jammu and Kashmir for

     Jammu and Kashmir police at SOG Camp, in the absence

     of the original panchnama and seizure memo drawn by

     answer this point in favour of the appellants and hold

     that the prosecution had failed to prove that the car

     was    used   by    A-6    to    carry     weapons   from    Jammu   and

     Kashmir to Bareilly for carrying out the attack on

     Akshardham.

<p id="p_355">     Answer to point no.7


</p><p id="p_356">     112.    The   independent         documentary     evidence    produced

     before us against the accused persons are the two

     letters in Urdu allegedly recovered from the pockets

     of    the   trousers      of    the   fidayeens,     upon    which    the

     prosecution had placed strong reliance to establish

     the    involvement        of    A-4   in   the   offence.    The   other

     independent evidence is the blue ambassador car in

     which A-6 was alleged to have brought the fidayeens

     and the weapons to Ahmedabad through Bareilly from

     Jammu and Kashmir. We have already ascertained while

     answering     the    point       about     the   above   letters     that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_278">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010              -223-</span>




     neither the two letters produced before the Special

     Court (POTA) nor the procedure by which the ambassador

     car     was   seized    by    the     Gujarat    police,    inspires

     confidence in our minds to show that these are genuine

     evidence      to   implicate    the    accused    persons     in   the

     offence. The only other material evidence on record on

     the basis of which the prosecution had argued the

     involvement        of   the     accused     persons,        are    the

     confessional statements given by A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4

     and A-6 before the Gujarat police under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_253">Section 32</a> of

     POTA. We have already mentioned that the confessional

     statements had not been recorded as per the strict

     statutory mandate provided for under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_254">Section 32</a> of

     POTA,     which     made      their    confessional        statements

     inadmissible as evidence. However, we also intend to

     record certain other reasons as to why the conviction

     and sentencing of the accused persons by the Special

     Court (POTA), which was upheld by the High Court in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_279">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010             -224-</span>

     confessional statements of the accused persons were

     recorded by the DCP, PW-78 in extremely suspicious

     circumstances. We have already held that the procedure

     of presenting them before the CJM and subsequently

     sending them to judicial custody mandatorily had been

     reduced to a mere, empty formality. This above said

     procedural      lapse    coupled    with      the    fact       that     the

     letters of caution to be given to them, before the

     making    of    such    statements,      mandated        under       <a href="/doc/1380216/" id="a_255">Section

     32(2)</a> of POTA, and the process of recording their

     confessional      statements      were     done     in    an    extremely

     casual manner which is not the conduct expected from

     such     high   ranking    police       officers         of    the     state

     government.      Since     we    have      already       recorded        our

       not have been made the only ground for convicting

              question   has  been   considered  on    several
              occasions by judicial decisions and it has been
              consistently held that a confession cannot be
              treated as evidence which is substantive
              evidence against a co-accused person. In
              dealing   with  a   criminal  case   where   the
              prosecution relies upon the confession of one
              accused person against another accused person,
              the proper approach to adopt is to consider the
              other evidence against such an accused person,
              and if the said evidence appears to be
              satisfactory and the court is inclined to hold

          framed against the said accused person, the
          court turns to the confession with a view to
          assure itself that the conclusion which it is
          inclined to draw from the other evidence is
          right. As was observed by Sir Lawrence Jenkins
          in <a href="/doc/1033901/" id="a_256">Emperor v. Lalit Mohan Chuckerburty, I.L.R</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_359">          38 Cal. 559 at p.588 a confession can only be
          used to "lend assurance to other evidence
          against a co-accused". In Peryaswami Moopan
          v.Emperor,I.L.R. 54 Mad. 75 at p.77: (AIR 1931
          Mad. 177 at p.178) Reilly, J., observed that
          the provision of<a href="/doc/1158561/" id="a_257"> S. 30</a> goes not further than
          this, "where there is evidence against the co-
          accused sufficient, if believed, to support his
          conviction,   then  the    kind of   confession
          described in<a href="/doc/1158561/" id="a_258"> S. 30</a> may be thrown into the scale
          as an additional reason for believing that
          evidence." In Bhuboni Sahu v. The King, 76 Ind
          App 147 at p.155: (AIR 1949 PC 257 at p.260)
          the Privy Council has expressed the same view.
          Sir John Beaumont who spoke for the Board,
          observed that,
                “a   confession   of    a co-accused   is
          obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does
          not indeed come within the definition of
          "evidence" contained in<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_259"> S. 3</a> of the Evidence
          Act. It is not required to be given on oath,
          nor in the presence of the accused, and it
          cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a
          much weaker type of evidence than the evidence
          of an approver, which is not subject to any of
          those infirmities. S. 30, however, provides
          that the Court may take the confession into
          consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it
          evidence on which the court may act; but the
          section does not say that the confession is to
          amount to proof. Clearly there must be other
          evidence. The confession is only one element in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_283">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -227-</span>




          the consideration of all the facts proved in
          the case; it can be put into the scale and
          weighed with the other evidence."
</p><p id="p_360">          It would be noticed that as a result of the
          provisions contained in<a href="/doc/1158561/" id="a_260"> S. 30</a>, the confession
          has no doubt to be regarded as amounting to
          evidence in a general way. because whatever is
          considered   by   the    court   is   evidence;
          circumstances which are considered by the court
          as well as probabilities do amount to evidence
          in that generic sense. Thus, though confession
          may be regarded as evidence in that generic
          sense because of the provisions of<a href="/doc/1158561/" id="a_261"> S. 30</a>, the
          fact remains that it is not evidence as defined
          by S.3 of the Act. The result, therefore, is
          that in dealing with a case against an accused
          person, the court cannot start with the
          confession of a co-accused person; it must
          begin with other evidence adduced by the
          prosecution and after it has formed its opinion
          with regard to the quality and effect of the
          said evidence, then it is permissible to turn
          to the confession in order to receive assurance
          to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial
          mind is about to reach on the said other
          evidence. That, briefly stated, is the effect
          of the provisions contained in<a href="/doc/1158561/" id="a_262"> S. 30</a>. The same
          view has been expressed by this Court in
          <a href="/doc/1924452/" id="a_263">Kashmira Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> 1952
          SCR 526 :(AIR 1952 SC 159) where the decision
          of the Privy Council in Bhuboni Sahu's case, 76
          Ind App 147 (AIR 1949 PC 257) has been cited
          with approval.

          of the co-accused persons stand on a different
          footing. In cases where such confessions are

           accused person, the Court cannot begin with the
           examination of the said statements. The stage
           to consider the said confessional statements
           arrives only after the other evidence is
           considered and found to be satisfactory. The
           difference in the approach which the Court has
           to adopt in dealing with these two types of
           evidence is thus clear, well-understood and
           well-established. It, however, appears that in
           Ram Prakash's case, 1959 SCR 1219: (AIR 1959 SC
</p><p id="p_363">           1), some observations have been made which do
           not seem to recognize the distinction between
           the   evidence  of   an   accomplice  and   the
           statements contained in the confession made by
           an accused person.”

</p><p id="p_364">     115. Again, in the present case, there is nothing on

     record other than the statements of the accomplices

     (of which PW- 51 retracted from his confession) and

     the   confessional   statements   of   the   accused   persons

     which were retracted and this aspect of the matter was

     required to be considered by the courts below while

     recording the findings on the charges framed against

     the    accused   persons.      The     retraction      of   the

     confessional statements of the accused persons A-2, A-

     were    tortured        by   the         police   to    extract     their

     confessional statements. Therefore, the confessional

     statements of A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6 cannot be relied

     upon for this reason also i.e they have been retracted

     vide Exs. 779 (A-2), 780 (A-4), 33 (A-3) and 32 (A-6).

     A-2    had    retracted      his    confessional        statement      vide

     was detained on the charge of ‘autorickshaw theft’ and

     was brought to the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad and forced

     to    confess    regarding         the    crime   of    attack    on    the

     Akshardham temple. He had stated that he was put to

     intense      physical    and   psychological           torture   and    the

     police threatened him and his family members with the

     motive of eliciting a confession out of him which he

     stated to be ‘false’ as he is not guilty of the same

     and had been falsely charged. Relevant portions of the

     retraction statement(Ex.779) are extracted hereunder

          night they took me to some officer. They
          removed the blindfold and released my hands.

          noon and at night, that is two to three times a
          day I was taken to the office of Singhal
          Vanzara sir. Vanar sir also remained present
          there. They presented a story of Akshsardham
          before me and asked me to repeat that story
          before senior officer and confess it. I refused
          and so mental and physical torture was effected
          on me. I was beaten with a stick everyday on my
          backside, feet and palms. They used to beat me
          so badly that I fell down on the floor.
          Sometimes, lips were attached on my hand
          fingers and current was given to me. Pins were
          pierced below the nails of my finger tips. Such
          inhuman torture wad done on me for about ten
          days from 17/8/03 to 29/8/03. I was illegally

          Singhal and VD Vanar. They told me that letters
          were found from both the dead terrorists at
          Akshardham complex. They asked me if I had
          written those letters. I replied that I had not
          written them and I do not know anything about
          it. On this they started torturing me mentally
          and physically. Then Singhal said it was ok,
          they knew I had not written those letters. He
          asked me read and rewrite the copy of the two
          letters. Saying so he gave me a copy of those
          two letters. I trusted them and copied those
          two letters.    Due to innocence I could not
          understand   their   conspiracy   and   I   was
          repeatedly asked to copy those letters by Vanar
          and RI Patel for three four days every night
          Patel and those urdu letters and asked me to
          copy them till three four o clock late night.
          They used bad words and said those letters were
          found from terrorists. They asked me to match
          the handwritings of these letters and exactly
          write in those many lines and paragraphs also
          must be at the same place. ...They threatened
          and forced me to write 40-50 copies of those
          letters.

          (Kashmir). Out of the officers present with me
          RI Patel repeatedly told me that there I would
          be presented before officer. He would ask me
          about Akshardham and I must repeat the false
          story which they had told me earlier. They
          threatened me if I revealed the truth, they
          would kill me and throw my body somewhere. They
          would inform my family that i would be killed
          in an encounter with the terrorists. They told
          me that I would be shown a person, they told me
          to identify him and then they presented me
          before those officers. I learnt the names of
          officers later as DIG K Rajendra, ACP Sandip

          a person and asked me if I knew him. I did not
          know that person at all. So I dared to say that
          I did not know him....

          that if I did so these officers would kill me
          and trouble my family too. At this DIG K
          Rajendra answered me that they would not let
          any trouble fall upon my family, if I told the
          truth. I was impressed with his words and
          started owning loudly. Due to his humanitarian
          approach, I gained confidence and told him that
          I   was  innocent   and   knew  nothing   about
          Akshardham. They answered me that they would
          not let injustice happen to innocent as they
          had arrested the person involved in this
          scandal. ...

          to read those papers. In them, I was accused

     This Court in the case of Navjot Sandhu (supra) while

     deciding   whether       the   same      rule    of   prudence   for

          corroboration in a broad sense, when it is
          retracted. The non obstante provision adverted
          to by the learned Judges should not, in our
          considered view, affect the operation of the
          general rule of corroboration broadly.”

        Further, in the case of Parmanada Pegu v. State of

        Assam57, this Court relied upon many judgments, most

        important of which is Subramania Goundan v. State of

        Madras58 which was relied upon in the case of Navjot

        Sandhu (supra), in order to hold that the confessional

        statement of the accused which is retracted, cannot be

        relied     upon   to   convict    him    in   the   absence   of

        corroborating evidence. In the Subramania Goundan case

        (supra), this Court held thus:
</p>
<p id="p_374">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_176">              “14. The next question is whether there is
              corroboration of the confession since it has
              been retracted. A confession of a crime by a
              person, who has perpetrated it, is usually the
              outcome of penitence and remorse and in normal
              circumstances is the best evidence against the
              maker. The question has very often arisen
              whether a retracted confession may form the
              basis of conviction if believed to be true and
              voluntarily made. For the purpose of arriving
              at this conclusion the court has to take into
              consideration not only the reasons given for
              making the confession or retracting it but the
              attending facts and circumstances surrounding



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_297">57</span>
      (2004) 7 SCC 779
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_298">58</span>
     AIR 1958 SC 66
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_299">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010     -241-</span>




          the same. It may be remarked that there can be
          no absolute rule that a retracted confession
          cannot be acted upon unless the same is
          corroborated materially. It was laid down in
          certain cases one such being In re. Kesava
          Pillai ILR 53 Mad 160: (AIR 1929 Mad 837) (B)
          that if the reasons given by an accused person
          for retracting a confession are on the face of
          them false, the confession may be acted upon as
          it stands and without any corroboration. But
          the view taken by this court on more occasions
          than one is that as a matter of prudence and
          caution which has sanctified itself into a rule
          of law, a retracted confession cannot be made
          solely the basis of conviction unless the same
          is corroborated one of the latest cases being
          'Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab (S) AIR 1957
          SC 216 (C) , but it does not necessarily mean
          that each and every circumstance mentioned in
          the confession regarding the complicity of the
          accused must be separately and independently
          corroborated nor is it essential that the
          corroboration   must   come   from   facts  and
          circumstances discovered after the confession
          was made. It would be sufficient, in our
          opinion,   that  the   general   trend  of  the
          confession is substantiated by some evidence
          which would tally with what is contained in the
          confession. In this connection it would be
          profitable to contrast a retracted confession
          with the evidence of an approver or an
          accomplice. Though under<a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_264"> S. 133</a> of the Evidence
          Act a conviction is not illegal merely because
          it proceeds on the uncorroborated testimony of
          witnesses, illustration (b) to<a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_265"> S. 114</a> lays down
          that a court may presume that an accomplice is
          unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in
          material particulars. In the case of such a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_300">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010         -242-</span>




          person on his own showing he is a depraved and
          debased individual who having taken part in the
          crime tries to exculpate himself and wants to
          fasten the liability on another. In such
          circumstances it is absolutely necessary that
          what he has deposed must be corroborated in
          material particulars. In contrasting this with
          the statement of a person making a confession
          who stands on a better footing, one need only
          find out when there is a retraction whether the
          earlier statement, which was the result of
          remorse,   repentance    and  contrition,   was
          voluntary and true or not and it is with that
          object that corroboration is sought for. Not
          infrequently one is apt to fall in error in
          equating a retracted confession with the
          evidence of an accomplice and therefore, it is
          advisable to clearly understand the distinction
          between the two. The standards of corroboration
          in the two are quite different. In the case of
          the person confessing who has resiled from his
          statement, general corroboration is sufficient
          while an accomplice's evidence should be
          corroborated   in   material  particulars.   In
          addition the court must feel that the reasons
          given for the retraction in the case of a
          confession are untrue.”

                                (emphasis laid by this Court)



     This above said view of this Court has been endorsed

     in   various   judgments    subsequently   and   we   find   it

     necessary to reiterate the same herein. The rule of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_301">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -243-</span>




     prudence as applying to confessions of the accused

     under the general law, being that the confessional

     statements which were retracted must be corroborated

     by independent evidence, must be followed to convict

     the accused for the charges framed against them. The

     findings and reasons for conviction and sentencing of

     the accused persons in this case were the confessional

     statements of A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6 and the two Urdu

     letters which are purportedly written by A-4. A-2, A-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_375">     3,   A-4    and   A-6    had    retracted      their    confessional

     statements as per the exhibits aforementioned and all

     of   them   had   alleged      that     they   were    tortured     and

     threatened    with      dire   consequences     of     death   through

     ‘encounter’ and death of their loved ones. All the

     accused     persons       speak    of     torture       by     beating,

     especially on the legs and this corresponds to their

     complaints of pain ‘under the feet’.

</p><p id="p_376">     117. Further, A-5 also made a statement as per Ex.778

     that he was tortured in police custody and that he had

     no role in the conspiracy to attack the Akshardham

     temple   and    he   was   being    framed      in    the   case.     The

     statements of retraction also referred to the repeated

     entreaties by accused persons before the Special Court

     (POTA) as well as by A-2, A-4 and A-5, before the DIG

     of Police at Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. K Rajendra Kumar

     to transfer the case to the CBI for an independent

     investigation and enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_377">     118. Further, A-6 had also retracted his confessional

     statement (Ex.32), wherein he had also alleged severe

     torture and beating by the Srinagar police as well as

     the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad and he alleged that he was

     arrested   at    Nagpur      and    sent   to        Srinagar   and     a

     compulsory confession had been extracted from him in

     order to implicate him in the crime.
</p>
<p id="p_378">     119. Further, with respect to the two Urdu letters,

     which were purportedly written by A-4, upon which the

     prosecution     placed     such    an   unflinching      reliance     in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_303">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010          -245-</span>




     order to establish a link between the fidayeens and

     the accused persons, has already been answered by us

     in point nos. 4 and 5 to be completely unreliable for

     the reasons stated by us in this judgment.

</p><p id="p_379">     120.   The story of the prosecution crumbles down at

     every juncture. Most importantly, the case laws relied

     upon above show that the statements of confession of

     the accused persons cannot be relied upon if they are

     retracted,        unless   corroborated      by    independent

     evidence. In this case, as already elucidated, the

     case   of   the   prosecution   rests   on   the   confessional

     statements on the accused persons, the confessional

     statements of the accomplices and their evidence and

     the two Urdu letters purportedly found in the pockets

     of the trousers of the fidayeens and written by A-4,

     and apart from this, it is very clear that there is

     absolutely no independent evidence to implicate the

     accused persons for the crime. The evidence of the

     accomplices, PW-50, PW-51 and PW-52 are also rejected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_304">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -246-</span>




        for the reasons given in the answer to point no.3.

        Therefore, there is no independent evidence on record

        which    corroborates   the   confessions      of   the   accused

        persons which were subsequently retracted.

</p><p id="p_380">              Further, a retracted confessional statement of an

        accused     person   cannot   be   used   to   corroborate    the

            this Court which proceeded on the basis that
            conviction of an accused on the basis of a
            retracted confession is permissible but only if
            it is found that retraction made by the accused
            was wholly on a false premise.......

            dispute that although retracted confession is
            admissible, the same should be looked with some
            amount of suspicion - a stronger suspicion than
            that which is attached to the confession of an
            approver who leads evidence to the court. ”

     Accordingly,        we    hold    that    there    is    no    independent

             first and primary condition and it is not

             acts. The agreement amongst the conspirators
             can be inferred by necessary implication. In
             most of the cases, the conspiracies are proved
             by   the   circumstantial  evidence,  as   the

            existence of conspiracy and its objects are
            usually deduced from the circumstances of the
            case and the conduct of the accused involved in
            the conspiracy. While appreciating the evidence
            of the conspiracy, it is incumbent on the court
            to keep in mind the well-known rule governing
            circumstantial evidence viz. each and every
            incriminating circumstance must be clearly
            established by reliable evidence and the
            circumstances proved must form a chain of
            events   from  which   the  only   irresistible
            conclusion about the guilt of the accused can
            be safely drawn, and no other hypothesis
            against   the  guilt   is  possible.   Criminal
            conspiracy is an independent offence in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_268"> the
            Penal Code</a>. The unlawful agreement is sine qua
            non for constituting offence under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_269"> the Penal
            Code</a> and not an accomplishment. Conspiracy
            consists of the scheme or adjustment between
            two or more persons which may be express or
            implied or partly express and partly implied.
            Mere knowledge, even discussion, of the plan
            would not per se constitute conspiracy. The
            offence of conspiracy shall continue till the

<blockquote id="blockquote_182">             “342. ….The elements of a criminal conspiracy
             have been stated to be: (a) an object to be
             accomplished, (b) a plan or scheme embodying
             means to accomplish that object, (c) an
             agreement or understanding between two or more
             of the accused persons whereby, they become

             means, and (d) in the jurisdiction where the
             statute required an overt act. The essence of a
             criminal conspiracy is the unlawful combination
             and ordinarily the offence is complete when the
             combination    is  framed.    From    this,  it
             necessarily follows that unless the statute so
             requires, no overt act needs be done in
             furtherance of the conspiracy, and that the
             object   of   the  combination   need    not be
             accomplished,   in  order   to   constitute  an
             indictable offence….”



       As   far    as   the   role   of   each    individual   accused   is

       concerned, it has been established by this Court that

       each individual conspirator need not know the contents

       of the entire conspiracy, or each and every step. It

        is possible that the co-conspirator’s knowledge of the

        conspiracy is limited to his role in the conspiracy,

        and he may have no knowledge about the actions of the

        other co-conspirators. In the case of Yash Pal Mittal

              for the first time in 1913 in Chapter V-A of
              the Penal Code. The very agreement, concert or
              league is the ingredient of the offence. It is
              not necessary that all the conspirators must
              know each and every detail of the conspiracy as

              division of performances in the chain of

     statements of the accused persons in order to set up

     the plea that the offence of criminal conspiracy had

     been    committed   by    each     one   of   them.   A   careful

     Further,    even     the      confessional              statements      of   the

     accused    persons      did        not    help      the     prosecution       to

     establish the chain of events in pursuance of the

     alleged     conspiracy.            In     fact,         they     are     highly

     contradictory and improbable in nature.

</p><p id="p_399">     126. According to the prosecution, as disclosed in the

     confessional statements of A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6,

     the conspiracy was hatched in Saudi Arabia, and money

     was     delivered      to     India       through        havala;       the   two

     fidayeens were apparently escorted to Ahmedabad by one

     Aiyub     Khan   and        they    also         brought       the   arms    and

     ammunition with them. It was stated that A-2 then took

     the fidayeens in his auto rickshaw and helped them

     reccie     places      in     Ahmedabad           and    Gandhinagar,        and

     finally helped them in choosing the Akshardham temple

     at Gandhinagar as a suitable place to carry out the

     attack and hence take the revenge against Hindus for

     the Godhra riots. According to the prosecution, A-2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_319">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010            -256-</span>




     also stated that the accommodation of the fidayeens

     was set up at Bavahir Hall.
</p>
<p id="p_400">           Per contra, as per the confessional statement of

     A-6, he was the one who brought the two fidayeens from

     Kashmir,   and   drove   the      car     with   ammunitions      from

     Kashmir to Bareilly, and then came to Ahmedabad in a

     train, and carried the ammunitions in bedding. A-6,

     according to the prosecution, was also the one who

     recceied   Gandhinagar      and     Ahmedabad      with     the    two

     fidayeens, before finally settling on Akshardham as

     the site of the attack. A-6 also stated, according to

     the   prosecution,   that   the     fidayeens      stayed    at    the

     Gulshan Guest House. Interestingly though, neither A-2

     nor A-6 speak of each other or each other’s role in

     the planning and conspiracy, even though they were

     both seemingly doing the same task, i.e, of arranging

     for the accommodation of the fidayeens, and making

     them reccie the cities of Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad

     and we wonder how there can be two versions of the

     same event.
</p>
<p id="p_401">     127. It is true that in order to establish criminal

     conspiracy, it is not required of every co-conspirator

     to know the entire sequence of the chain and events,

     and that they can still be said to be conspirators

     even if they are only aware of their limited roles and

     are    not   able   to   identify   the   role   of   any    other

     conspirator. But that is not the case here. It is not

     the case here that the knowledge of the conspirators

     is limited to their role. Each accused claims to have

     complete      knowledge     of      the   conspiracy,        while

     contradicting the other’s version of the same events

     to constitute the act of criminal conspiracy.

</p><p id="p_402">     128.   Therefore,    the   confessional    statements       of   the

     accused persons and the accomplices do not complement

     each other to form a chain of events leading to the

     offence. Rather, the depositions of the prosecution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_321">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010             -258-</span>




     witnesses were contradictory and disrupt the chain of

     events and turn it into a confusing story with many

     discrepancies,      defeating      the     roles    of    each    of   the

     accused persons which have been allegedly performed by

     them. Also, none of the events of the alleged criminal

     conspiracy was supported by independent evidence that

     inspires     confidence     in     our     minds     to     uphold     the

     conviction    and   sentences      meted     out    to    the    accused

     persons.
</p>
<p id="p_403">     128. Hence, we hold that the prosecution has failed to

        While examining as to whether this Court has the power

        to   interfere   with   the   concurrent   findings   of   fact

        recorded by the courts below, it was held in the case

              Court perceives that a manifest injustice has
              been occasioned. If and when the Court is
              satisfied that great injustice has been done it
              is not only the “right” but also the “duty” of
              this Court to reverse the error and the
              injustice    and    to   upset   the    finding
              notwithstanding the fact that it has been
              affirmed thrice………… It is not the number of
              times that a finding has been reiterated that
              matters. What really matters is whether the
              finding is manifestly an unreasonable, and
              unjust one in the context of evidence on

              perceived to have been perpetuated. But in any

     were presented before us. The investigation process

     post Akshardham attack happened as under:


       • The incidence of Akshardham happened in the
         intervening  nights   between  24.09.2002  and
         25.09.2002. An FIR was registered by PW-126 on
         25.09.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_412">       • According to the instruction of Superintendent
         of Police, the investigation of the complaint
         was handed over to Police Inspector Shri V.R.
         Tolia (PW-113).
</p>
<p id="p_413">       • The investigation was then handed over to the
         Anti Terrorist Squad on 03.10.2002.

       • The investigation was thereafter handed over to
         the Crime Branch which was assigned to PW-126
         on 28.08.2003 at 6:30 p.m.

       • The statement of PW-50 was taken at 8 p.m, on
         the same night of 28.08.2003, after receiving
         verbal instruction from higher officer-D.G.
         Vanzara in the morning.
</p>
<p id="p_414">       • A-1 to A-5 were arrested on 29.08.2003.

       • POTA was invoked on 30.08.2003.
</p>
<p id="p_415">       • The I.G.P. Kashmir sends a fax message to
         I.G.P.   operations   ATS  Gujarat   state on
         31.08.2003 regarding A-6 being in the custody
         of Kashmir Police and that he has stated that
         he was involved in the Akshardham attack.

       • A-6 was brought to Ahmedabad on 12.09.2003 and
         was arrested at 9:30 p.m.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_334">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010           -266-</span>




       • A-1 and A-3 confessed on 17.09.2003.

       • A-2 and A-4 confessed on 24.09.2003.

       • A-6 confessed on 05.10.2003.

<p id="p_416">       • A-6 was brought to Ahmedabad on 12.09.2003 and
         was arrested at 9:30 p.m.



     A careful observation of the above said dates would

     show that the ATS was shooting in the dark for about a

     year   without    any    result.      No    trace       of    the    people

     associated with this heinous attack on the Akshardham

     temple    could   be    found   by    the       police.      Then   on   the

     morning    of   28.03.2003,     the    case       is    transferred       to

     Crime Branch, Ahmedabad. This was followed by D.G.

     Vanzara    giving      instructions        to     the     then-ACP       G.S.

     Singhal (PW-126) about one Ashfaq Bhavnagri (PW-50).

     PW-126 was thereafter made in charge of the case on

     the same evening at 6:30 p.m. and the statement of PW-

     50 was recorded at 8 p.m., i.e within one and a half

     hours. This shrouds our minds with suspicion as to why

     such a vital witness- D.G. Vanzara, who discovered the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_335">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010             -267-</span>




     link to the accused persons, was not examined by the

     Special Court (POTA). The courts below accepted the

     facts    and   evidence     produced       by   the   police   without

     being suspicious about the extreme coincidences with

     which the chain of events unfolded itself immediately

     that is, within 24 hours of the case being transferred

     to the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad.
</p>
<p id="p_417">     132. We are reminded of the legendary lines of Justice

     Vivian    Bose   in   the   case    of     Kashmira    Singh’s    case

     (supra) wherein he cautioned that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_196">          “2. The murder was a particularly cruel and
          revolting one and for that reason it will be
          necessary to examine the evidence with more
          than ordinary care lest the shocking nature of
          the crime induce an instinctive reaction
          against the dispassionate judicial scrutiny of
          the facts and law.”
                            (emphasis laid by this court)




     The courts below have not examined the evidence with

     ‘more than ordinary care’. Firstly, the Special Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_336">Crl.A.Nos.2295-2296 of 2010                -268-</span>




     (POTA)    accepted       the     justification          made    by    the

     prosecution in sending the accused persons to police

     custody after being produced before the CJM on the

     ground that there was no complaint made by them.</blockquote><p id="p_418">

</p><p id="p_419">           Secondly,    the   courts       below     held   that    the   fact

     that A-1 to A-5 did not know A-6, does not disprove

     the theory of criminal conspiracy, rather it displays

     the   extreme     caution      with    which    the    conspiracy    was

     hatched. We are unable to bring ourselves to agree

     with this reasoning of the courts below, as in the

     instant case, not only did A-1 to A-5 not know A-6 and

     vice versa, but also A-2, A-4 and A-6 had narrated

     different versions of the same story, each of which

     contradicted the other and was actually fatal to the

     case of the prosecution. The courts below mechanically

     and   without     applying       their        mind,    discarded     this

     contention of the learned counsel on behalf of the

     accused persons.

     been recovered from the pockets of the trousers of the

     fidayeens (Ex.658), did not have even a drop of blood,

     mud or perforation by the bullets, whereas on physical

     examination of the trousers by us, which are marked as

     mudammal objects, we found that the clothes on the

     pockets of the fidayeens were perforated with bullets

     and smeared with dried blood even after 12 years of

     the incident.

<p id="p_422">          The Special Court (POTA) however, did not find it

     imperative to examine why the letters recovered from

     the pockets of the trousers of the fidayeens were

     spotless. It admitted the letters as evidence merely

     on the basis of the confessional statement of A-4 who

     had, in his statement recorded that he had written the

     letters and had also kept the pen to prove that the

     letters were written with the same pen. The Special

     Court (POTA) also admitted the letters as evidence on

     the ground that signatures of Brigadier Raj Sitapati

     as    per    the    statement      of     PW-91     Major      Lamba,    were

     present on those letters. The High Court admitted the

     letters      as    evidence   on    the         ground    that    “truth    is

     stranger than fiction” by overlooking not only the

     most impossible fact that the letters marked by the

     police were spotless, but also ignoring the evidence

     of PW-105 who in his deposition recorded that there

     were no signatures of Brigadier Sitapati or anyone

     else on the letters when they were handed over to PW-

     the fact that they have not given the same weightage

     to     the   defence     witnesses          as     they     have    to     the

     prosecution witnesses. The learned senior counsel for

     the accused persons contended that the courts below

     should have given same weigthage to the evidence of

     the    defence      witnesses      as     that     of    the     prosecution

     witnesses. However, the evidence of DW-3 was not only

              It has been held by this Court in a catena of

        cases that while examining the witnesses on record,

        equal     weightage   shall   be   given   to   the   defence

        witnesses as that of the prosecution witnesses.           In

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_201">              “3..…Before drawing the curtain on this score

              be termed to be a tainted one by reason of the
              factum of the witnesses being examined by the
              defence. The defence witnesses are entitled to
              equal respect and treatment as that of the
              prosecution. The issue of credibility and the
              trustworthiness ought also to be attributed to

        Further, it has been held in the case of State of

        Haryana v. Ram Singh70 as under:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_202">              “19. …………Incidentally, be it noted that the
              evidence tendered by defence witnesses cannot
              always be termed to be a tainted one — the
              defence   witnesses   are  entitled  to   equal
              treatment and equal respect as that of the
              prosecution. The issue of credibility and the
              trustworthiness ought also to be attributed to
              the defence witnesses on a par with that of the
              prosecution. Rejection of the defence case on
              the basis of the evidence tendered by the
              defence witness has been effected rather
              casually by the High Court. Suggestion was
              there   to   the   prosecution  witnesses,   in
              particular PW 10 Dholu Ram that his father
              Manphool was missing for about 2/3 days prior
              to the day of the occurrence itself — what more
              is expected of the defence case: a doubt or a
              certainty — jurisprudentially a doubt would be
              enough: when such a suggestion has been made
              the prosecution has to bring on record the
              availability of the deceased during those 2/3
              days with some independent evidence. Rejection
              of the defence case only by reason thereof is
              far too strict and rigid a requirement for the
              defence to meet — it is the prosecutor’s duty
              to prove beyond all reasonable doubts and not
              the defence to prove its innocence — this
              itself is a circumstance, which cannot but be
              termed to be suspicious in nature.”

              One of the contentions adverted to by the
              learned counsel is pertaining to the evidence
              of the defence witness (DW 1 Moharam Ali).
              Counsel contended that if the evidence of DW 1
              Moharam Ali can be believed it is sufficient to
              shake the basic structure of the prosecution
              evidence. Shri N.P. Midha invited our attention

</blockquote><p id="p_429">     134. The courts below had ignored these basic legal

     principles while admitting the statement of witnesses

     while weighing the case against the accused persons.

     While the decision of the Special Court (POTA) found

     mention   of   DW-1,     DW-2,   DW-4,     DW-5   and     DW-6,   the

     evidence of DW-3 which indicated that some of the

     accused persons might have actually been detained in

     police    custody   much    before       the   official    date   of

     However, FIR-ICR No. 3090 of 2003 (Ex.733) in the

     present case shows that DW-3 was arrested along with

     some other women under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_281">Section 188</a> IPC for protesting

     against detention of some persons from their area.

     down by this Court, we are convinced that accused

     persons     are   innocent     with   respect   to   the    charges

     leveled against them. We are of the view that the

     judgment and order of the Special Court (POTA) in POTA

     case No. 16 of 2003 dated 01.07.2006 and the impugned

     judgment and order dated 01.06.2010 of the High Court

     of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Criminal Confirmation Case

     Consequently, the sentences of death awarded to A-2,

     A-4 and A-6, life imprisonment awarded to A-3, 10

     years of Rigorous Imprisonment awarded to A-5 are set

     aside. Since we are acquitting all the accused in

     appeal before us for the reasons mentioned in this

     judgment    and    also,     since   A-1    was    convicted    and

     sentenced on the basis of the same evidence which we

     have already rejected, we also acquit A-1 who is not

     in appeal before us, of the conviction and sentence of

     5 years Rigorous Imprisonment awarded to him by the

     courts below, exercising the power of this Court under

     <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_284">Article    142</a>    of   the   Constitution    and   hold   him   not

     guilty of the charges framed against him. We are aware

     that he has already served his sentence. However, we

     intend to absolve him of the stigma he is carrying of

     that of a convict, wrongly held guilty of offences of

     terror so that he is able to return to his family and

     society, free from any suspicion.

     booking the real culprits responsible for taking so

     many precious lives, the police caught innocent people
