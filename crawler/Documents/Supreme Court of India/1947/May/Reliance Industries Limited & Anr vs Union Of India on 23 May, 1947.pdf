<p id="p_2">1. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High

  Court of Delhi at New Delhi rendered in OMP No.46 of 2013

  dated 22nd March, 2013. By the aforesaid judgment, the

  Delhi High Court has allowed the petition filed by the

  <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_3">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996’), challenging the Final Partial Award

  dated 12th September, 2012. By the aforesaid Award, the

  objection raised by the Union of India relating to the

  arbitrability of the claims made by the petitioner in respect of

  Royalties, Cess, Service Tax and CAG Audit have been

  rejected.

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3. Before we discuss the legal issues, it would be pertinent to

  make a very brief note of the relevant facts.



</p><p id="p_6">4. The parties had entered into Two Production Sharing

  Contracts dated 22nd December, 1994 (as amended by

  Amendment Agreement No.1 and Amendment Agreement

  No.2) (hereinafter referred to as “PSC” or “PSCs”) as and

  when appropriate. These two PSCs provide for the

  exploration and production of petroleum from the Mid and

  South Tapti Fields (hereinafter referred to as “Tapti” or “Tapri

  Field”) and for the exploration and production of petroleum

  from Panna and Mukta Fields which shall be hereinafter

  referred to either as “Panna Mukta” or “Panna Mukta fields”.

  The two PSCs shall be referred to “Tapti PSC” and “Panna

  Mukta PSC,” respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">5. One of the PSCs was entered into with Reliance Industries

  Limited (RIL), the appellant, a body corporate established

  under the laws of India. It is a major Indian multinational and

  the largest private sector company in India, with interests in

  activities including exploration and production of oil and gas,

  petroleum refining and marketing petrochemicals, textiles,

  retail and special economic zones. The other PSC was

  entered into with BG Exploration and Production India

  Limited (“BG”), a body corporate established under the laws

  of the Cayman Islands. It is a company forming part of BG

  Group, an international energy group headquartered in the

  United Kingdom with business operations in numerous

  countries. In 2002, BG Group acquired the share capital of

  Enron Oil and Gas India Limited (EOGIL, a company

  formerly part of the Enron group of companies). Upon its

  acquisition on 15th February, 2003, the name of EOGIL was

  changed to BG Exploration and Production India Limited.



</p><p id="p_9">6. ONGC is a state-owned oil and gas company in India in

  which the Government of India holds a 74.14 % equity stake.

  It produces various petroleum products including crude oil,

  natural gas and LPG. These three companies are together

  defined as the “Contractor” (in the PSCs Clause 1.23).



</p><p id="p_10">7. The two PSCs provide a detailed procedure for Alternative

  Dispute Redressal Mechanisms. Articles 32 and 33 of the

  PSCs are relevant for this purpose. These Articles provide

  as under :
</p>
<p id="p_11">     “<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Article 32</a> – Applicable Law and Language of
     the Contract –

     32.1 Subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_5">Article 33.12</a>, this
     Contract shall be governed and interpreted in
     accordance with the laws of India.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     32.2 Nothing in this Contract shall entitle the
     Government or the Contractor to exercise the rights,
     privileges and powers conferred upon it by this
     Contract in a manner which will contravene the laws
     of India.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     32.3 The English language shall be the language of
     this Contract and shall be used in arbitral
     proceedings. All communication, hearings or visual
     materials or documents relating to this Contract
     shall be in English.

     Arbitration :
</p>
<p id="p_15">     33.1 The Parties shall use their best efforts to settle
     amicably all disputes, differences or claims arising
     out of or in connection with any of the terms and
     conditions of this Contract or concerning the
     interpretation or performance thereof.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                   5</span>

33.2 Except for matters which, by the terms of this
Contract, the Parties have agreed to refer to a sole
expert and any other matters which the Parties may
agree to so refer, any dispute, difference or claim
arising between the Parties hereunder which cannot
be settled amicably may be submitted by any Party
to arbitration pursuant to <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_7">Article 33.3.</a> Such sole
expert shall be an independent and impartial person
of international standing with relevant qualifications
and experience appointed by agreement between
the Parties. Any sole expert appointed shall be
acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator and the
decision of the sole expert on matters referred to
him shall be final and binding on the Parties and not
subject to arbitration. If the Parties are unable to
agree on a sole expert, the disputed subject matter
may be referred to arbitration.
</p>
<p id="p_16">33.3 Subject to the provisions herein, any
unresolved dispute, difference or claim which
cannot be settled amicably within a reasonable time
may, except for those referred to in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_8">Article 33.2</a>, be
submitted to an arbitral tribunal for final decision as
hereinafter provided.
</p>
<p id="p_17">33.4 The arbitral tribunal shall consist of three
arbitrators. The Party or Parties instituting the
arbitration shall appoint one arbitrator and the Party
or Parties responding shall appoint another
arbitrator and both Parties shall so advise the other
Parties. The two arbitrators appointed by the Parties
shall appoint the third arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_18">33.5 Any Party may, after appointing an arbitrator,
request the other Party (ies) in writing to appoint the
second arbitrator. If such other Party fails to appoint
an arbitrator within forty-five (45) days of receipt of
the written request to do so, such arbitrator may, at
the request of the first Party, be appointed by the
Secretary General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration at the Hague, within forty-five (45) days
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                     6</span>

of the date of receipt of such request, from amongst
persons who are not nationals of the country of any
of the Parties to the arbitration proceedings.

33.6 If the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties
fail to agree on the appointment of the third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the appointment
of the second arbitrator and if the Parties do not
otherwise agree, the Secretary General of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague may, at
the request of either Party and in consultation with
both, appoint the third arbitrator who shall not be a
national of the country of any Party.
</p>
<p id="p_19">33.7 If any of the arbitrators fails or is unable to act,
his successor shall be appointed in the manner set
out in this Article as if he was the first appointment.

33.8 The decision of the arbitration tribunal and, in
the case of difference among the arbitrators, the
decision of the majority, shall be final and binding
upon the Parties.
</p><p id="p_20">33.9 Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in
accordance with the arbitration rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL) of 1985 except that in the event of any
conflict between these rules and the provisions of
this <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_9">Article 33</a>, the provisions of this <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_10">Article 33</a> shall
govern.
</p>
<p id="p_21">33.10 The right to arbitrate disputes and claims
under this Contract shall survive the termination of
this Contract.
</p>
<p id="p_22">33.11 Prior to submitting a dispute to arbitration, a
Party may submit the matter for conciliation under
the UNCITRAL conciliation rules by mutual
agreement of the Parties. If the Parties fail to agree
on a conciliator (or conciliators) in accordance with
the rules, the matter may be submitted for
arbitration. No arbitration proceedings shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                        7</span>

     instituted while conciliation proceedings are pending
     and such proceedings shall be concluded within
     sixty (60) days.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     33.12 The venue of conciliation or arbitration
     proceedings pursuant to this Article, unless the
     Parties otherwise agree, shall be London, England
     and shall be conducted in the English Language.
     The arbitration agreement contained in this <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_11">Article
     33</a> shall be governed by the laws of England.
     Insofar as practicable, the Parties shall continue to
     implement     the    terms      of     this   Contract
     notwithstanding the initiation of arbitral proceedings
     and any pending claim or dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_24">     33.13 The fees and expenses of a sole expert or
     conciliator appointed by the Parties shall be borne
     equally by the Parties. Assessment of the costs of
     arbitration including incidental expenses and liability
     for the payment thereof shall be at the discretion of
     the arbitrators.”


</p><p id="p_25">8. In accordance with <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_12">Article 33.12</a>, the arbitral proceedings

  were to be held in London as the neutral venue. At the time

  of entering into the PSCs, none of the parties were domiciled

  in U.K. In fact, subsequently, the venue of the arbitral

  proceedings was shifted to Paris and again re-shifted to

  London. Consequently                   on 24th February, 2004,

  the parties to the PSCs entered into an agreement amending

  the PSCs, whereby it was stated that :-
</p>
<p id="p_26">     “4. Applicable Law and Arbitration :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                         8</span><p id="p_27">

       Except the change of venue/seat of Arbitration
     from London to Paris, the Articles 32 and 33 of the
     Contract shall be deemed to be set out in full in
     this Agreement mutatis mutandis and so that
     references therein to the Contract shall be
     references to this Agreement.”



</p><p id="p_28">9. It appears that certain disputes and differences have arisen

  between the parties, under or in connection with the PSCs.

  Consequently, the appellant issued a notice of arbitration

  dated 16th December, 2010. The disputes, differences and

  claims are common to both the Tapti PSC and Panna &amp;

  Mukta PSC. The appellant claims that all attempts to resolve

  the   disputes    with   the   respondent   amicably       through

  correspondences and meetings have failed. The disputes,

  differences and claims arising out of or in connection with

  the PSCs have been summarized in paragraph 6 of the

  notice of arbitration.
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">10.Pursuant to the aforesaid notice, the arbitral tribunal was

  duly constituted on 29th July, 2011. Under <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_13">Article 33.12</a>, the

  venue of arbitration is in London. The parties confirmed the

  term of appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal on 29th July,

  2011, signed by the Chairman on 15th August, 2011. A
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                          9</span>

  substantive hearing was held between 21st May, 2012 to 29th

  May, 2012 in Singapore. Thereafter, on the basis of the

  amendment made in the PSC as noticed above, by

  agreement of the parties, the arbitral tribunal made the “Final

  Partial Consent Award” on 14th September, 2011. In the

  aforesaid award, it is recorded as under :

     “3. Final Partial Award as to Seat

     3.1 Upon the agreement of the Parties, each
     represented by duly authorized representatives and
     through counsel, the Tribunal hereby finds, orders
     and awards:

<p id="p_31">     a) That without prejudice to the right of the Parties
     to subsequently agree otherwise in writing, the
     juridical seat (or legal place) of arbitration for the
     purposes of the arbitration initiated under the
     Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration dated 16th
     December, 2010 shall be London, England.

</p><p id="p_32">     b) That any hearings in this arbitration may take
     place in Paris, France, Singapore or any other
     location the Tribunal considers may be convenient.

</p><p id="p_33">     c) That, save as set out above, the terms and

<p id="p_54">

                     raised by the appellants (claimants) with respect to royalties;

                     that the issue of arbitrability is governed by the law of the

                     seat of arbitration. The seat of the arbitration being England,

                     the issue of arbitrability is governed by the English Law. It

                     was also submitted that although challenge to the validity of

                     the terms of PSC is governed by Indian Law (<a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_30">Article 32.1</a> of

                     the PSC), nevertheless it falls within the jurisdiction of the

                     tribunal just as any other substantive dispute. The appellants

                     relied upon the judgment in Tamil Nadu Electricity Board

  that the reliefs claimed are founded, only, on contractual

  rights. Further, whether or not any of those contractual rights

  are vitiated by <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_31">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 is

  a question of substance and accordingly a dispute as to the

  relevant legislation but the claims of the appellants are

  purely contractual in nature.

</p><p id="p_73">23.Union of India challenged the aforesaid award before the

  High Court of Delhi in OMP No.46 of 2013. The respondents

  invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_32">Section 34</a> of

  the Arbitration Act for various reasons namely, (i) the terms

  of the PSCs entered would manifest an unmistakable

  intention of the parties to be governed by the laws of India

  and more particularly the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_33">Arbitration Act</a> 1996; (ii) the

  contracts were signed and executed in India; (iii) the subject

  matter of the contracts, namely, the Panna Mukta and the

  Tapti Fields are situated within India; (iv) the obligations

  under the contracts have been for the past more than 15

  years performed within India; (v) the contracts stipulate that

  they “shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with

  the laws of India”; (vi) they also provided that “nothing in this

  rights, privileges and powers conferred upon them by the

  contract “in a manner which will contravene the laws of

  India” (<a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_34">Article 32.2</a>); and (vii) the contracts further stipulate

  that “the companies and the operations under this Contract

  shall be subject to all fiscal legislation of India” (<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_35">Article 15.1</a>).



</p><p id="p_74">24.The   appellant     raised    preliminary    objection        to   the

  maintainability of the arbitration petition primarily on the

  ground that by choosing English Law to govern their

  agreement to arbitration and expressly agreeing to London

  seated arbitration, the parties have excluded the application

  of Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It was submitted that

  the High Court of Delhi had no jurisdiction to entertain the

  objection filed by the Union of India under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_36">Section 34</a> of the

  Arbitration Act, 1996. It was emphasized that Courts of

  England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain

  any challenge to the award. It was pointed out that the PSCs

  were amended on two occasions. On 24th February, 2004,

  PSC was sought to be amended to change the seat of

  arbitration from London to Paris. However, on 14th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                        22</span>

  September, 2011, the parties to the arbitration agreed that

  the seat of the present arbitration proceedings would be

  London, England. This agreement is recorded in the Final

  Partial   Consent Award rendered by the arbitral tribunal

  on 29th July, 2011. As noticed earlier, the final partial consent

  award provided that the juridical seat or legal place of

  arbitration for the purpose of arbitration initiated under the

  claimants notice of arbitration                      dated 16 th

  December, 2011 shall be London, England. <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_37">Article 33.9</a> of

  the PSC provides that the arbitration shall be conducted in

  accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, 1985. However,

  subsequently it was recorded in the award that the

  applicable rules shall be the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,

  1976. It was also submitted on behalf of the appellants that

  the objections raised by the UOI are yet to be determined by

  the tribunal on merits and shall be considered after

  considering the evidence at the time of rendering the final

  award.
</p>
<p id="p_75">

</p><p id="p_76">25.Upon consideration of the entire matter, the High Court has

  held that undoubtedly the governing law of the contract i.e.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                      23</span>

proper law of the contract is the law of India. Therefore, the

parties never intended to all together exclude the laws of

India, so far as contractual rights are concerned. The Laws

of England are limited in their applicability in relation to

arbitration agreement contained in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_38">Article 33.</a> This would

mean that the English Law would be applicable only with

regard to the curial law matters i.e. conduct of the arbitral

proceedings. For all other matters, proper law of the contract

would be applicable. Relying on <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_39">Article 15(1</a>), it has been

held that the fiscal laws of India cannot be derogated from.

Therefore, the exclusion of Indian public policy was not

envisaged by the parties at the time when they entered into

the contract. The High Court further held that to hold that the

agreement contained in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_40">Article 33</a> would envisage the

matters other than procedure of arbitration proceedings

would be to re-write the contract. The High Court also held

that the question of arbitrability of the claim or dispute cannot

be examined solely on the touchstone of the applicability of

the law relating to arbitration of any country but applying the

public policy under the laws of the country to which the

parties have subjected the contract to be governed.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                      24</span>

Therefore, according to the High Court, the question of

arbitrability of the dispute is not a pure question of applicable

law of arbitration or lex arbitri but a larger one governing the

public policy. The High Court then concluded that public

policy of India cannot be adjudged under the laws of

England. <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_41">Article 32.1</a> specifically provides that laws of India

will govern the obligations of the parties in the PSCs. The

High Court also concluded that the effect of the interplay of

conclusion that law of England shall operate in relation to

matters contained in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_45">Article 33</a> in so far as they are not

inconsistent with the law of India. Since the question of

arbitrability of the claim is a larger question effecting public

policy of State it should be determined by applying laws of

India. This would give a meaningful effect to <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_46">Article 32.2</a>,

otherwise it would be rendered otiose. On the basis of the

aforesaid plain reading, according to the High Court, the

conclusion is that the intention of the parties under the

agreement was always to remain subject to Indian laws and

not to contravene them. It is further held that <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_47">Article 33</a> was

confined to conducting the arbitration in accordance with the

                       laws of England and not for all other purposes. Relying on

                       the judgment of this Court in Bhatia International Vs. Bulk

                       Trading S.A. &amp; Anr.2, it has been held that Part I of the

                       Arbitration Act, 1996 would be applicable as there is no clear

                       express or implied intention of the parties to exclude the

                       applicability of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_48">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996. The High Court also

                       relies on the judgment of this Court in Venture Global

                       Engineering Vs. Satyam Computer Services Ltd.3, in

                       support of the conclusion that the Delhi High Court has

                       jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the petition under

                       <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_49">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Since, according to

                       High Court, the dispute raised by the appellant relate to

                       public policy of India, the petition under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_50">Section 34</a> of the

                       Arbitration Act is maintainable. The High Court also gives

                       additional reasons for concluding that the petition to

                       challenge final partial award is maintainable. According to

                       the High Court, the disputes involved rights in rem.

                       Therefore, due regard has to be given to Indian laws. An

                       award which is said to be against public policy can be

                       permitted to be challenged in India even though the seat of

arbitration is outside India. The High Court also took support

from the doctrine of public trust with regard to natural

resources. Since the appellants are seeking refund of

amount of cess, royalties, service tax, all matters of public

money in India, the jurisdiction of the Indian courts cannot be

excluded. The High Court concludes that there is no reason

why the public money be allowed to invested for seeking

adjudication of the claims which may be eventually found to

be impermissible to be enforced. Finally, the High Court

declined to consider the law laid down by the Constitution

Bench of this Court in Bharat Aluminium on the basis that

the operation of the judgment has been made prospective by

the court. The final conclusion has been given in paragraph

59 which is as under :
</p>
<p id="p_77">   “59. No submission on the part of the respondents
   remains unaddressed. I have already observed that
   upon testing the instant case on the principles of
   law laid down in the case of Bhatia International

   ence as to express or implied exclusion of the Part I
   of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_51">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 can be
   drawn. Resultantly, the objection raised by the re-
   spondents relating to lack of jurisdiction of Indian
   court on the count of express choice of laws provi-
   sions cannot be sustained as Indian laws including
   provisions of Part I of the Act are not expressly nor

  He submits that the High Court has wrongly intermingled the

  issues relating to the challenge to the arbitral proceedings or

  the arbitration award with the merits of the disputes relating

  to the underlying contract. According to him, even if the law

  laid down in Bhatia International (supra) is applicable, the

  arbitral tribunal would apply the provisions contained in the

                     misplaced. In that case, the Court was not concerned with a

                     clause such as <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_54">Article 32.1</a> of the PSC, which has to be

                     was wholly misplaced and erroneous. The High Court has

                     failed to appreciate that <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_56">Article 32.1</a> and <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_57">32.2</a> deal only with

                     the proper law of the contract and not with the proper law of

                     the arbitration agreement. The High Court has erroneously

                     distinguished the ratio of law laid down in Videocon

                     Industries Limited (supra) on the ground that although the

                     arbitration clause therein was the same but the question of

                     public policy had not been addressed by the Court. Relying

                     on State of Gujarat &amp; Anr. Vs. Justice R.A. Mehta

                     (Retired) &amp; Ors.8, Dr. Singhvi submitted that even if the

                     issue of public policy was not particularly raised or

                     addressed, the judgment in Videocon Industries Limited

                     (supra) still be a binding precedent. According to him, whilst

                     concluding that the parties did not intend to exclude the

                     applicability of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_58">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 to the arbitration

                     agreement, the High Court has erroneously held that it was

                     necessary for the parties to exclude not only the provisions

                     of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_59">Arbitration Act</a> but also specifically plead that public

                     policy is also excluded.      According to the learned senior

                     counsel,   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_60">Article   15.6.1</a>    has   no   relevance    for   the

  London.
</p>
<p id="p_83">

</p><p id="p_84">30.Mr. A.K. Ganguly, learned senior counsel appearing for

  Union of India submits that the decision in this case has

  been correctly rendered by the High Court based on the law

  laid down by this Court in Bhatia International and Venture

  Global Engineering (supra) as the arbitration agreement is

  pre BALCO. He submits that in order to determine whether

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_62">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 is excluded, the contract had to be

  seen as a whole. Here, the contract is in India, for the work

  to be done in India over 25 years; secondly, it deals with

  natural resources, Union of India is a trustee of these

  resources for the citizens of India. London was designated

  as the seat of arbitration only to provide certain measure of

  comfort level to the foreign parties. The contract can not be

  read in such a way as to exclude the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_63">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996.

  The High Court has correctly concluded that arbitrability had

  to be decided by taking into consideration Indian Laws,

  which would include the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_64">Indian Arbitration Act</a> and not under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                    31</span>

the English Arbitration Act, 1996. He emphasized that the

present proceedings relate to the interpretation of the

contract, which is of national importance to develop the oil

rich areas in the Indian Coasts. He points out that under the

PSC, the contractor has agreed to be always mindful of the

rights and interests of India in the conduct of petroleum

operations [<a href="/doc/817707/" id="a_65">Article 7.3(a)].</a> Mr. Ganguly also relied on <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_66">Article

32.1</a> and <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_67">32.2</a> and submitted that Contract is to be governed

and interpreted in accordance with laws of India. He points

out that there is a negative covenant in <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_68">Article 32.2</a>, wherein

Government or the contractor are not entitled to exercise the

rights, privileges, and powers conferred under the PSC in a

manner which will contravene laws of India. Mr. Ganguly

further pointed out that the High Court has correctly applied

the law laid down by this court in Bhatia International and

Venture Global Engineering (supra). He also objected to

the additional documents, which are sought to be relied upon

by the petitioners in I.A. No. 7 of 2014. He submitted that

none of these documents were on the record before the High

Court and can not be permitted to be relied on for the first

time in this Court. He, therefore, submitted that I.A. No. 2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                        32</span>

  ought to be dismissed. He submitted that similar request

  was made before the High Court, which was rejected.



</p><p id="p_85">31.Mr. Ganguly emphasized that the issues raised by the Union

  of India are of public law and not purely contractual as

  sought to be projected by the appellants. He points out that

  the appellants have sought a number of reliefs with respect

  to CAG Audit. It is a challenge to the conclusions recorded

  by the CAG Audit and such a challenge would not be

  arbitrable.   It is further submitted by him that the issues

  raised with regard to royalty is also not arbitrable as it is not

  a commercial issue. He has distinguished the judgment of

  this Court in Videocon Industries Limited (supra) on the

  basis that the issue with regard to the public law was not

  considered by the Court in that judgment.



</p><p id="p_86">32.As noticed earlier, both the learned senior counsel have also

  submitted written submissions. Primarily, the submissions

  made in the Court have been reiterated and, therefore,

  reference will be made to the same as and when necessary.

</p><p id="p_89">34.Before we analyze the submissions made by the learned

  senior counsel for both the parties, it would be appropriate to

  notice the various factual and legal points on which the

  parties are agreed. The controversy herein would have to be

  decided on the basis of the law declared by this Court in

  Bhatia International (supra). The parties are agreed and it

  is also evident from the Final Partial Consent Award dated

  14th September, 2011 that the juridical seat (or legal place) of

  arbitration for the purposes of the arbitration initiated under

  the Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration dated 16th December,

  2010 shall be London, England. The parties are also agreed

  that hearings of the Notice of Arbitration may take place at

  Paris, France, Singapore or any other location the Tribunal

  considers may be convenient. It is also agreed by the parties

  that the terms and conditions of the arbitration agreement in

  <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_69">Article 33</a> of the PSCs shall remain in full force and effect

  and be applicable to the arbitration proceedings.

</p><p id="p_90">35.The essential dispute between the parties is as to whether

  Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be applicable to the

  arbitration agreement irrespective of the fact that the seat of

  arbitration is outside India. To find a conclusive answer to

  the issue as to whether applicability of Part I of the

  Arbitration Act, 1996 has been excluded, it would be

  necessary to discover the intention of the parties. Beyond

  this parties are not agreed on any issue.
</p>
<p id="p_91">

</p><p id="p_92">36.We are also of the opinion that since the ratio of law laid

  down in Balco (supra) has been made prospective in

  operation by the Constitution Bench itself, we are bound by

  the decision rendered in Bhatia International (supra).

  Therefore, at the outset, it would be appropriate to reproduce

  the relevant ratio of Bhatia International in paragraph 32

  which is as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_93">     “32. To conclude, we hold that the provisions of
     Part I would apply to all arbitrations and to all pro-
     ceedings relating thereto. Where such arbitration is
     held in India the provisions of Part I would com-
     pulsorily apply and parties are free to deviate only to
     the extent permitted by the derogable provisions of
     Part I. In cases of international commercial arbitra-
     tions held out of India provisions of Part I would ap-
     ply unless the parties by agreement, express or im-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                       35</span>

     plied, exclude all or any of its provisions. In that
     case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would
     prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to
     or excluded by that law or rules will not apply.”


</p><p id="p_94">37.In view of the aforesaid, it would be necessary to analyze

  the relevant Articles of the PSC, to discover the real intention

  of the parties as to whether the provisions of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_70">Arbitration Act</a>,

  1996 have been excluded. It must, immediately, be noticed

  that Articles 32.1 and 32.2 deal with applicable law and

  language of the contract as is evident from the heading of

  the Article which is “Applicable Law and Language of the

  Contract”. <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_71">Article 32.1</a> provides the proper law of the contract

  i.e. laws of India. <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_72">Article 32.2</a> makes a declaration that none

  of the provisions contained in the contract would entitle

  either the Government or the Contractor to exercise the

  rights, privileges and powers conferred upon it by the

  contract in a manner which would contravene the laws of

  India.
</p>
<p id="p_95">

</p><p id="p_96">38.<a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_73">Article 33</a> makes very detailed provision with regard to the

  resolution of disputes through arbitration. The two Articles do

  not overlap - one (<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_74">Art.32</a>) deals with the proper law of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                         36</span>

contract, the other (<a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_75">Art.33</a>) deals with ADR, i.e. consultations

between the parties; conciliation; reference to a sole expert

and ultimately arbitration. Under <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_76">Article 33</a>, at first efforts

should be made by the parties to settle the disputes among

themselves (33.1). If these efforts fail, the parties by

agreement shall refer the dispute to a sole expert (33.2). The

provision with regard to constitution of the arbitral tribunal

provides that the arbitral tribunal shall consist of three

arbitrators (33.4). This article also provides that each party

shall appoint one arbitrator. The arbitrators appointed by the

parties shall appoint the third arbitrator. In case, the

procedure under <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_77">Article 33.4</a> fails, the aggrieved party can

approach the Permanent Court of Arbitration at Hague for

appointment of an arbitrator (33.5). Further, in case the two

arbitrators fail to make an appointment of the third arbitrator

within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator,

again the Secretary General of the Permanent Court of

Arbitration at Hague may, at the request of either party

appoint the third arbitrator. In the face of this, it is difficult to

appreciate the submission of the respondent – Union of India

that the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_78">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 (Part I) would be applicable to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                        37</span>

  the arbitration proceedings. In the event, Union of India

  intended to ensure that the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_79">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 shall apply

  to the arbitration proceedings, <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_80">Article 33.5</a> should have

  provided that in default of a party appointing its arbitrator,

  such arbitrator may, at the request of the first party be

  appointed by the Chief Justice of India or any person or

  Institution designated by him. Thus, the Permanent Court of

  Arbitration at Hague can be approached for the appointment

  of the arbitrator, in case of default by any of the parties. This,

  in our opinion, is a strong indication that applicability of

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_81">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 was excluded by the parties by

  consensus. Further, the arbitration proceedings are to be

  conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, 1976

  (33.9). It is specifically provided that the right to arbitrate

  disputes and claims under this contract shall survive the

  termination of this contract (33.10).

<p id="p_97">39.The Article which provides the basis of the controversy

  herein is <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_82">Article 33.12</a> which provides that venue of the

  arbitration shall be London and that the arbitration

  agreement shall be governed by the laws of England.             It

  Award, the parties have agreed that the juridical seat (or

  legal place of arbitration) for the purposes of arbitration

  initiated under the claimants’ notice of arbitration dated 16th

  December, 2010 shall be London, England.



</p><p id="p_98">40.We are of the opinion, upon a meaningful reading of the

  aforesaid Articles of the PSC, that the proper law of the

  contract is Indian Law; proper law of the arbitration

  agreement is the law of England. Therefore, can it be said as

  canvassed    by   the   respondents,    that   applicability   of

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_83">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 has not been excluded?



</p><p id="p_99">41.It was submitted by Mr. Ganguly that the intention of the

  parties was never to exclude the applicability of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_84">Arbitration

  Act</a>, 1996. It is submitted that the expression “laws of India”

  under <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_85">Article 32.2</a> would also include the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_86">Arbitration Act</a>,

  1996. This submission is without any merit. In our opinion,

  the expression “laws of India” as used in <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_87">Article 32.1</a> and

  <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_88">32.2</a> have a reference only to the contractual obligations to

  be performed by the parties under the substantive contract

  i.e. PSC. In other words, the provisions contained in 33.12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                        39</span>

  are not governed by the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_89">Article 32.1.</a>

  It must be emphasized that <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_90">Article 32.1</a> has been made

  subject to the provision of <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_91">Article 33.12.</a> <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_92">Article 33.12</a>

  specifically provides that the arbitration agreement shall be

  governed by the laws of England. The two Articles are

  particular in laying down that the contractual obligations with

  regard to the exploration of oil and gas under the PSC shall

  be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of

  India. In contra-distinction, <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_93">Article 33.12</a> specifically provides

  that the arbitration agreement contained in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_94">Article 33.12</a> shall

  be governed by the laws of England. Therefore, in our

  opinion, the conclusion is inescapable that applicability of

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_95">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 has been ruled out by a conscious

  decision and agreement of the parties. Applying the ratio of

  law as laid down in Bhatia International (supra) it would

  lead to the conclusion that the Delhi High Court had no

  jurisdiction to entertain the petition under <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_96">Article 34</a> of the

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_97">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996.

litigation.   Therefore, there is no violation of 32.2, as

<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_99">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996, in fact signifies Parliamentary sanction

of ADR. In fact, <a href="/doc/618177/" id="a_100">Article 32.3</a> indicates that obligations under

PSC and Arbitration Agreement are separate. Hence, it is

provided that English shall be the language of the Contract.

Followed by the stipulation that English shall also be the law

of arbitral proceedings.   Therefore, the conclusion of the

High Court that PSC is a composite contract is not in tune

with the approved provisions of the PSC. This separateness

is further emphasized by <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_101">Article 32.1</a> by making the provision

“subject to the provision of <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_102">Article 33.12</a>”.    Laws of India

have been made applicable to the substantive contract. Law

of England govern the Dispute Resolution Mechanism.

Provision for Arbitration is a deliberate election of remedy

other than usual remedy of a civil suit. The ADR mechanism

under the Arbitral Laws of different nations is legally and

jurisprudentially accepted, sanctified by the Highest Law

Making Bodies of the member States, signatories to the New

York Convention. India is not only a signatory to the New

York Convention, but it has taken into account the

UNCITRAL Model Laws and the UNCITRAL Rules, whilst
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                       41</span>

  enacting the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_103">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996. Therefore, it would not be

  possible to accept the submission of Mr. Ganguly that the

  Law of the Contract is also the Law of the Arbitration

  Agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_102">

</p><p id="p_103">43.In our opinion, it is too late in the day to contend that the

  seat of arbitration is not analogous to an exclusive

  jurisdiction clause. This view of ours will find support from

  numerous judgments of this Court. Once the parties had

  consciously agreed that the juridical seat of the arbitration

  would be London and that the arbitration agreement will be

  governed by the laws of England, it was no longer open to

  them to contend that the provisions of Part I of the Arbitration

  Act would also be applicable to the arbitration agreement.

  This Court in the case of Videocon Industries Ltd. (supra)

  has clearly held as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_104">     “33. In the present case also, the parties had
     agreed that notwithstanding <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_104">Article 33.1</a>, the
     arbitration agreement contained in <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_105">Article 34</a> shall
     be governed by laws of England. This necessarily
     implies that the parties had agreed to exclude the
     provisions of Part I of the Act. As a corollary to the
     above conclusion, we hold that the Delhi High Court
     did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition
     filed by the respondents under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_106">Section 9</a> of the Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                       42</span>

     and the mere fact that the appellant had earlier filed
     similar petitions was not sufficient to clothe that
     High Court with the jurisdiction to entertain the
     petition filed by the respondents.”


</p><p id="p_105">44.In coming to the aforesaid conclusion this Court interpreted

  similar if not identical provisions contained in the arbitration

  agreement. The provision with regard to proper law of the

  contract and the arbitration agreement was as follows :

</p><p id="p_113">45.We are of the opinion that in the impugned judgment the

  High Court has erred in not applying the ratio of law laid

  down in Videocon Industries Ltd. (supra) in the present

  case. The first issue raised in Videocon Industries Limited

  (supra) was as to whether the seat of arbitration was

  London or Kuala Lumpur. The second issue was with regard

  to the Courts that would have supervisory jurisdiction over

  the arbitration proceedings. Firstly, the plea of Videocon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                        44</span>

  Industries Limited was that the seat could not have been

  changed from Kuala Lumpur to London only on agreement

  of    the parties without     there   being   a   corresponding

  amendment in the PSC. This plea was accepted. It was

  held that seat of arbitration cannot be changed by mere

  agreement of parties. In Paragraph 21 of the judgment, it

  was observed as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       “21. Though, it may appear repetitive, we deem it
       necessary to mention that as per the terms of
       agreement, the seat of arbitration was Kuala Lum-
       pur. If the parties wanted to amend <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_112">Article 34.12</a>,
       they could have done so only by a written instru-
       ment which was required to be signed by all of
       them. Admittedly, neither was there any agreement
       between the parties to the PSC to shift the juridical
       seat of arbitration from Kuala Lumpur to London nor
       was any written instrument signed by them for
       amending <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_113">Article 34.12.</a> Therefore, the mere fact
       that the parties to the particular arbitration had
       agreed for shifting of the seat of arbitration to Lon-
       don cannot be interpreted as anything except phys-
       ical change of the venue of arbitration from Kuala
       Lumpur to London.”


</blockquote><p id="p_114">46.The other issue considered by this Court in Videocon

  Industries Limited (supra) was as to whether a petition

  under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_114">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be

  maintainable in Delhi High Court, the parties having

  specifically agreed that the arbitration agreement would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                       45</span>

  governed by the English Law.         This issue was decided

  against Union of India and it was held that Delhi High Court

  did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by

  Union of India under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_115">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act.



</p><p id="p_115">47.In the present appeal, this Court is also considering the

  issue as to whether the petition under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_116">Section 34</a> of the

  Arbitration Act, 1996 filed by Union of India in Delhi would be

  maintainable.     The parties have made the necessary

  amendment in the PSCs to provide that the juridical seat of

  arbitration shall be London.     It is also provided that the

  arbitration agreement will be governed by laws of England.

  Therefore, the ratio in Videocon Industries Limited (supra)

  would be relevant and binding in the present appeal.



</p><p id="p_116">48.The aforesaid judgment (Videocon) has been rendered by

  this   Court    upon   consideration    of   Venture      Global

  Engineering (supra). Venture Global Engineering and

  Videocon Industries Ltd. are both judgments delivered by

  two-Judge Bench.       In our opinion, the factual and legal

  issues involved in the Videocon Industries case are very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                         46</span>

  similar to the controversy involved in the present appeal.

  The Arbitration Agreement in this appeal is identical to the

  arbitration agreement in Videocon Industries. In fact, the

  factual situation in the present appeal is on a stronger

  footing than in Videocon Industries Limited (supra). As

  noticed    earlier,   in   Videocon     Industries,   this   Court

  concluded that the parties could not have altered the seat of

  arbitration without making the necessary amendment to the

  PSC.      In the present appeal, necessary amendment has

  been made in the PSC.                 Based on the aforesaid

  amendment, the Arbitral Tribunal has rendered the Final

  Partial Consent Award of 14th September, 2011 recording

  that the juridical seat (or legal place) of the arbitration for the

  purposes of arbitration initiated under the Claimant’s Notice

  of Arbitration                        dated 16 th December, 2010

  shall be London, England.        Furthermore, the judgment in

  Videocon Industries is subsequent to Ventura Global. We

  are, therefore, bound by the ratio laid down in Videocon

  Industries Limited (supra).

<p id="p_117">

                     Industries has been followed on numerous occasions by a

                     number of High Courts. This apart, the judgment of this

                     Court in Videocon Industries Ltd. also reflects the view

                     taken by the Courts in England on the same issues. In the

                     case of A Vs. B9 considering a similar situation, it has been

                     held as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                         ““…..an agreement as to the seat of an arbitration is
                         analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Any
                         claim for a remedy……as to the validity of an
                         existing interim or final award is agreed to be made

<p id="p_119">                  50.This Court in Dozco India Ltd. (supra) again reiterated the

                     principle of law laid down in Sumitomo Heavy Industries

                     Ltd. (supra), wherein the law was very clearly enunciated in

                     Para 16:

                         arbitrate and the performance of that agreement.”

  judgment in Venture Global is based. This again persuades

  us to follow the law laid down in Videocon (supra).



</p><p id="p_121">52.Again this Court in Yograj Infrastructure (two-Judge

  Bench) considered a similar arbitration agreement. It was

  provided that the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted

  in English in Singapore in accordance with the Singapore

  International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules. (Clause 27.1).

  Clause 27.2 provided that the arbitration shall take place in

  Singapore and be conducted in English language. This Court

  held that having agreed that the seat of arbitration would be

  Singapore and that the curial law of the arbitration

  proceedings would be SIAC Rules, it was no longer open to

  the appellant to contend that an application under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_117">Section

</p><p id="p_122">53.This judgment has specifically taken into consideration the

                         course but, in my judgment, they fail to grapple with
                         the central point at issue which is whether or not, by
                         choosing London as the seat of the arbitration, the
                         parties must be taken to have agreed that
                         proceedings on the award should be only those
                         permitted by English law. In my view they must be
                         taken to have so agreed for the reasons given by
                         the judge. The whole purpose of the balance
                         achieved by the Bermuda Form (English arbitration
                         but applying New York law to issues arising under

                         award should be those permitted by English law and
                         only those so permitted. Mr Hirst could not say (and
                         did not say) that English judicial remedies for lack of
                         jurisdiction on procedural irregularities under
                         <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_118">sections 67</a> and <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_119">68</a> of the 1996 Act were not
                         permitted; he was reduced to saying that New York
                         judicial    remedies      were also permitted.    That,
                         however, would be a recipe for litigation and (what

                          with the award. There would be a serious risk of
                          parties rushing to get the first judgment or of
                          conflicting decisions which the parties cannot have
                          contemplated.”


</p><p id="p_127">                 55.The aforesaid observations were subsequently followed by

                       the High Court of Justice Queen’s Bench Division,

                       Commercial Court (England) in SulameRica CIA Nacional

                       De Seguros SA Vs. Enesa Engenharia SA – Enesa11. In

                       laying down the same proposition, the High Court noticed

                       that the issue in this case depends upon the weight to be

                       given to the provision in Condition 12 of the insurance policy

                       that “the seat of the arbitration shall be London, England.” It

                       was observed that this necessarily carried with it the English

                       Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration process.

                       It was observed that “this follows from the express terms of

                       the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_120">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 and, in particular, the provisions of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">11</span>
     (2012) WL 14764
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                                         51</span>

  <a href="/doc/738672/" id="a_121">Section 2</a> which provide that Part I of the Arbitration Act,

  1996 applies where the seat of the arbitration is in England

  and Wales or Northern Ireland. This immediately establishes

  a strong connection between the arbitration agreement itself

  and the law of England. It is for this reason that recent

  authorities have laid stress upon the locations of the seat of

  the arbitration as an important factor in determining the

  proper law of the arbitration agreement.”



</p><p id="p_128">56.In our opinion, these observations are fully applicable to the

  facts and circumstances of this case. The conclusion

  reached by the High Court would lead to the chaotic situation

  where the parties would be left rushing between India and

  England for redressal of their grievances. The provisions of

  Part I of the Arbitration Act 1996 (Indian) are necessarily

  excluded; being wholly inconsistent with the arbitration

  agreement which provides “that arbitration agreement shall

  be governed by English law.” Thus the remedy of the

  respondent to challenge any award rendered in the

  arbitration   proceedings   would   lie under    the        relevant

  provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_122">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 of England and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                       52</span>

  Wales. Whether or not such an application would now be

  entertained by the courts in England is not for us to examine,

  it would have to be examined by the Court of Competent

  Jurisdiction in England.
</p>
<p id="p_129">

Public Policy:
</p>
<p id="p_130">57.Mr. Ganguly has vehemently argued that the issues involved

  here relate to violation of public policy of India. Therefore,

  the applicability of Part I of the Indian Arbitration Act cannot

  be excluded even if the seat of arbitration is London. It would

  also, according to           Mr. Ganguly, make no difference

  that the arbitration agreement specifically provides for the

  arbitration agreement to be governed by the Laws of

  England. According to Mr. Ganguly, proper law of the

  contract would be relevant to determine the question as to

  whether the interim final award would be amenable to

  challenge under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_123">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996. In

  our opinion, the aforesaid submission of the learned counsel

  runs counter to the well settled law in India as well as in

  other jurisdictions. As noticed earlier,      Mr. Ganguly has

  submitted that the disputes in relation to royalties, cess,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                                        53</span>

  service tax and the CAG audit report are not arbitrable. In

  support of this submission, he relies on the provisions

  contained in <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_124">Article 15.1</a> read with <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_125">Article 32.2.</a> Relying upon

  these two Articles,           Mr. Ganguly submitted that the

  obligation with regard to taxes, royalties, rentals etc. are not

  purely contractual, they are governed by the relevant

  statutory provisions. He, therefore, placed strong reliance on

  the judgment in Venture Global (supra) in support of his

  submission that since the disputes are not arbitrable, the

  award cannot be enforced under Part II of the Arbitration Act,

  1996 but is amenable to challenge under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_126">Section 34</a> of the

  Act. It would be appropriate to point out that the judgment in

  Venture Global is in two parts. The first part is based on

  Bhatia International Ltd., wherein it is held as follows :-

     “32. …….In cases of international commercial arbit-
     rations held out of India provisions of Part I would
     apply unless the parties by agreement, express or
     implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. In that
     case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would
     prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to
     or excluded by that law or rules will not apply.”

</p><p id="p_131">58.In this case, the parties have by agreement provided that the

  juridical seat of arbitration will be in London. On the basis of

  the aforesaid agreement, necessary amendment has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                                       54</span>

  made in the PSCs. On the basis of the agreement and the

  consent of the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal has made the

  “Final Partial Consent Award” on 14th September, 2011 fixing

  the juridical seat (or legal place) of arbitration for the

  purposes of arbitration initiated under the claimants notice of

  arbitration dated 16th December, 2010 in London, England.

  To make it even further clear that the award also records

  that any hearing in the arbitration may take place in Paris,

  France, Singapore or any other location the tribunal

  considers convenient. <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_127">Article 33.12</a> stipulates that arbitration

  proceedings shall be conducted in English language. The

  arbitration agreement contained in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_128">Article 33</a> shall be

  governed by the laws of England. A combined effect of all

  these factors would clearly show that the parties have by

  express agreement excluded the applicability of Part I of the

  Arbitration Act, 1996 (Indian) to the arbitration proceedings.



</p><p id="p_132">59.We are also unable to agree with Mr. Ganguly that Part I of

  the Arbitration Act, 1996 (Indian) would be applicable in this

  case, in view of the law laid down by this Court in Venture

  Global Engineering (supra). In our opinion, even the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                                    55</span>

second part of the ratio in Venture Global Engineering

(supra) from paragraph 32 of the judgment onwards would

not be applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.

Firstly, in our opinion, all the disputes raised by the

petitioners herein are contractual in nature. Secondly, the

performance of any of these obligations would not lead to

any infringement of any of the laws of India per se. Thirdly,

the non-obstante clause which was under consideration in

Venture Global is non-existent in the present case. In

Venture Global, the court was concerned with direct

violation of <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_129">Foreign Exchange Management Act</a>. The actions

of the respondents therein would also have been contrary to

various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_130">Companies Act</a> in the event the

shares were to be transferred in accordance with the award.

Therefore, this Court was persuaded to take the view that

inspite of the applicability of Part I having been excluded as

the seat of arbitration was outside nonetheless Part I would

apply as the transfer of the shares would be against the laws

of India and, therefore, violate public policy. In our opinion,

such circumstances do not exist in the present case as there

is no danger of violation of any statutory provisions. Prima
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                                    56</span>

facie, it appears that there is no challenge to the Gazette

Notification. In fact, claim statement shows that the amounts

of royalties/cess levied have been paid.        Prayer is for

reimbursement of the amounts paid, based on Articles 15.6

and 15.7 of the PSC. There also seems to be a claim for

making necessary revisions and adjustment to the contract

to off-set the effect of any changes in the law. We fail to see

any apparent or so patently obvious violation of Indian Laws

in any of these claims. The basis for filing the petition under

<a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_131">Section 34</a> is that the Appellants are bound to obey the Laws

of the country. The appellants have nowhere claimed to be

exempted from the Laws of India.         They claim that the

Government of India, party to the Contract, i.e., PSC has

failed to seek and obtain exemption as stipulated in the

contract. Whether or not the claim has substance is surely

an arbitral matter. It is not the case of the appellants that

they are not bound by the Laws of India, relating to the

performance of the contractual obligations under the PSCs.

In view of what we have said earlier, it is not possible to

sustain the conclusion reached by the High Court.         The

arbitration agreement can not be jettisoned on the plea that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                                     57</span>

  award, if made against the Government of India, would

  violate Public Policy of India. Merely because the Arbitral

  Tribunal has held that claims are arbitral does not mean that

  the claims have been accepted and an award adverse to

  India has been given. We, therefore, have no hesitation in

  rejecting the submission made by Mr. Ganguly. For the

  same reasons, we are unable to sustain the conclusions

  reached by the High Court of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_133">

</p><p id="p_134">60.Another good reason for not accepting or approving the

  conclusions reached by the High Court is that it has failed to

  distinguish between the law applicable to the proper law of

  the contract and proper law of the arbitration agreement.

  The High Court has also failed to notice that by now it is

  settled, in almost all international jurisdictions, that the

  agreement to arbitrate is a separate contract distinct from

  the substantive contract which contains the arbitration

  agreement. This principle of severability of the arbitration

  agreement from the substantive contract is indeed statutorily

  recognized by <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_132">Section 16</a> of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996.

</blockquote><p id="p_135">62.This principle of separability permits the parties to agree:

  that law of one country would govern to the substantive

  contract and laws of another country would apply to the

  arbitration agreement. The parties can also agree that even

  the conduct of the reference would be governed by the law

  of another country. This would be rare, as it would lead to

  extremely complex problems. It is expected that reasonable

  businessman do not intend absurd results. In the present

  case, the parties had by agreement provided that the

  substantive contract (PSC) will be governed by the laws of

  India. In contradistinction, it was provided that the arbitration

  agreement will be governed by laws of England. Therefore,

  there was no scope for any confusion of the law governing

  the PSC with the law governing the arbitration agreement.

  This principle of severability is also accepted specifically

  under <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_134">Article 33.10</a> of the PSC, which is as under:-

          This was specifically amended and incorpor-
     ated in the present PSCs signed on 22nd December,

  September, 2011, signed by all the three members of the

  arbitral tribunal recording that the juridical seat of the

  arbitration initiated under the Claimant’s Notice dated 16th

  December, 2010 shall be London, England. Therefore, we

  are unable to accept the conclusion reached by the Delhi

  High Court and the submission made by Mr. Ganguly that

  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_137">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 (Part I) would be applicable to the

  arbitration agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_141">

</p><p id="p_142">66.Mr. Ganguly has next sought to persuade us that the seat of

  arbitration shall be in India as the PSC is governed by the

  law of India. According to Mr. Ganguly, laws of India would

  include the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_138">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996. Therefore, irrespective of

  the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_139">Article 33.12</a>, <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_140">Arbitration Act</a>,

  1996 would be applicable to arbitration proceedings. The

  English law would be applicable only in relation to the

  conduct of the arbitration upto the passing of the Partial Final

  Award. We are unable to accept the aforesaid submissions

  of   Mr. Ganguly.     As noticed earlier, <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_141">Article 32.1</a> itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                     62</span>

33.12.</a> <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_143">Article 33.12</a> provides that the arbitration agreement

contained in this Article shall be governed by the laws of

England.        The term ‘laws of England’ cannot be given a

restricted meaning confined to only curial law. It is

permissible under law for the parties to provide for different

laws of the contract and the arbitration agreement and the

curial law. In Naviera Amazonica SA (supra), the Court of

Appeal     in    England   considered   an   agreement       which

contained a clause providing for the jurisdiction of the courts

in Lima, Peru in the event of judicial dispute and at the same

time contained a clause providing that the arbitration would

be governed by the English Law and the procedural law of

arbitration shall be the English Law. The Court of Appeal

observed as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_143">   “All contracts which provide for arbitration and
   contain a foreign element may involve three
   potentially relevant systems of law: (1) the law
   governing the substantive contract; (2) the law
   governing the agreement to arbitrate and the
   performance of that agreement; (3) the law
   governing the conduct of the arbitration. In the
   majority of cases all three will be the same. But (1)
   will often be different from (2) and (3). And
   occasionally, but rarely (2) may also differ from (3).”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                                       63</span>



</p><p id="p_144">67.From the above, it is evident that it was open to the parties

  to agree that the law governing the substantive contract

  (PSC) would be different from the law governing the

  arbitration agreement. This is precisely the situation in the

  present case. <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_144">Article 32.1</a> specifically provides that the

  performance of the contractual obligations under the PSC

  would be governed and interpreted under the laws of India.

  So far as the alternative dispute redressal agreement i.e. the

  arbitration agreement is concerned, it would be governed by

  laws of England. There is no basis on which the respondents

  can be heard to say that the applicability of laws of England

  related only to the conduct of arbitration reference. The law

  governing the conduct of the arbitration is interchangeably

  referred to as the curial law or procedural law or the lex fori.

  The delineation of the three operative laws as given in

  Naviera Amazonica (supra) has been specifically followed

  by this Court in the case of Sumitomo (supra). The court

  also, upon a survey, of a number of decisions rendered by

  the English Courts and after referring to the views expressed

  by learned commentators on International Commercial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                                        64</span>

  Arbitration concluded that:-
</p>
<p id="p_145">     “16. The law which would apply to the filing of the
     award, to its enforcement and to its setting aside
     would be the law governing the agreement to arbit-
     rate and the performance of that agreement.”


</p><p id="p_146">68.In coming to the aforesaid conclusion, this Court relied on a

  passage from Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in

  England, 2nd Edn. by Mustill and Boyd which is as under :

     “An agreed reference to arbitration involves two
     groups of obligations. The first concerns the mutual
     obligations of the parties to submit future disputes,
     or an existing dispute to arbitration, and to abide by
     the award of a tribunal constituted in accordance
     with the agreement. It is now firmly established that
     the arbitration agreement which creates these oblig-
     ations is a separate contract, distinct from the sub-
     stantive agreement in which it is usually embedded,
     capable of surviving the termination of the substant-
     ive agreement and susceptible of premature termin-
     ation by express or implied consent, or by repudi-
     ation or frustration, in much the same manner as in
     more ordinary forms of contract. Since this agree-
     ment has a distinct life of its own, it may in principle
     be governed by a proper law of its own, which need
     not be the same as the law governing the substant-
     ive contract.
</p>
<p id="p_147">     The second group of obligations, consisting of what
     is generally referred to as the ‘curial law’ of the ar-
     bitration, concerns the manner in which the parties
     and the arbitrator are required to conduct the refer-
     ence of a particular dispute. According to the Eng-
     lish theory of arbitration, these rules are to be ascer-
     tained by reference to the express or implied terms
     of the agreement to arbitrate. This being so, it will
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                                    65</span>

be found in the great majority of cases that the curi-
al law, i.e., the law governing the conduct of the ref-
erence, is the same as the law governing the obliga-
tion to arbitrate. It is, however, open to the parties to
submit, expressly or by implication, the conduct of
the reference to a different law from the one govern-
ing the underlying arbitration agreement. In
such a case, the court looks first at the arbitration
agreement to see whether the dispute is one which
should be arbitrated, and which has validly been
made the subject of the reference, it then looks to
the curial law to see how that reference should be
conducted and then returns to the first law in order
to give effect to the resulting award.

It may therefore be seen that problems arising out
of an arbitration may, at least in theory, call for the
application of any one or more of the following laws
—

</p><p id="p_149">      1. The proper law of the contract, i.e., the law
      governing the contract which creates the sub-
      stantive rights of the parties, in respect of
      which the dispute has arisen.
</p>
<p id="p_150">      2. The proper law of the arbitration agree-
      ment, i.e., the law governing the obligation of
      the parties to submit the disputes to arbitra-
      tion, and to honour an award.
</p>
<p id="p_151">      3. The curial law, i.e., the law governing the
      conduct of the individual reference.
</p>
<p id="p_152">                     *      *     *

</p><p id="p_153">1. The proper law of the arbitration agreement gov-
erns the validity of the arbitration agreement, the
question whether a dispute lies within the scope of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                                         66</span>

     the arbitration agreement; the validity of the notice
     of arbitration; the constitution of the tribunal; the
     question whether an award lies within the jurisdic-
     tion of the arbitrator; the formal validity of the award;
     the question whether the parties have been dis-
     charged from any obligation to arbitrate future dis-
     putes.
</p>
<p id="p_154">     2. The curial law governs the manner in which the
     reference is to be conducted; the procedural
     powers and duties of the arbitrator; questions of
     evidence; the determination of the proper law of the
     contract.
</p>
<p id="p_155">     3. The proper law of the reference governs the
     question whether the parties have been discharged
     from their obligation to continue with the reference
     of the individual dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_156">                          *      *     *

     In the absence of express agreement, there is a
     strong prima facie presumption that the parties in-
     tend the curial law to be the law of the ‘seat’ of the
     arbitration, i.e., the place at which the arbitration is
     to be conducted, on the ground that that is the
     country most closely connected with the proceed-
     ings. So in order to determine the curial law in the
     absence of an express choice by the parties it is
     first necessary to determine the seat of the arbitra-
     tion, by construing the agreement to arbitrate.”


</p><p id="p_157">69.The same legal position is reiterated by this Court in Dozco

  (supra). In paragraph 12 of the judgment, it is observed as

  follows :
</p>
<p id="p_158">     “12. In the backdrop of these conflicting claims, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                                        67</span>

     question boils down to as to what is the true inter-
     pretation of <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_145">Article 23.</a> This <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_146">Article 23</a> will have to be
     read in the backdrop of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_147">Article 22</a> and more particu-
     larly, <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_148">Article 22.1.</a> It is clear from the language of
     <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_149">Article 22.1</a> that the whole agreement would be gov-
     erned by and construed in accordance with the laws
     of The Republic of Korea. It is for this reason that
     the respondent heavily relied on the law laid down
     in Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. ONGC Ltd.6
     This judgment is a complete authority on the pro-
     position that the arbitrability of the dispute is to be
     determined in terms of the law governing arbitration
     agreement and the arbitration proceedings have to
     be conducted in accordance with the curial law. This
     Court, in that judgment, relying on Mustill and Boyd:
     The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in
     England, 2nd Edn., observed in para 15 that where
     the law governing the conduct of the reference is
     different from the law governing the underlying arbit-
     ration agreement, the court looks to the arbitration
     agreement to see if the dispute is arbitrable, then to
     the curial law to see how the reference should be
     conducted, “and then returns to the first law in order
     to give effect to the resulting award”. In para 16, this
     Court, in no uncertain terms, declared that the law
     which would apply to the filing of the award, to its
     enforcement and to its setting aside would be the
     law governing the agreement to arbitrate and the
     performance of that agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_159">

  agreement.     For the same reasons, we are unable to

  approve the conclusions reached by the Delhi High Court

  that reference to laws of England is only confined to the

  procedural aspects of the conduct of the arbitration

  reference.
</p>
<p id="p_162">

</p><p id="p_163">72.We are also unable to agree with the submission of Mr.

  Ganguly that since the issues involved herein relate to the

  public policy of India, Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would

  be applicable. Applicability of Part I of Arbitration Act, 1996 is

  not dependent on the nature of challenge to the award.

  Whether or not the award is challenged on the ground of

  public policy, it would have to satisfy the pre-condition that

  the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_151">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 is applicable to the arbitration

  agreement. In our opinion, the High Court has committed a

  jurisdictional error in holding that the provisions contained in

  <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_152">Article 33.12</a> is relevant only for the determination of the

  curial law applicable too the proceedings. We have already

  noticed earlier that the parties by agreement have provided

  that the juridical seat of the arbitration shall be in London.

  Necessary amendment has also been made in the PSCs, as

  recorded by the Final Partial Consent Award dated 14th

  September, 2011. It is noteworthy that the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_153">Arbitration Act</a>,

  1996 does not define or mention juridical seat. The term

  ‘juridical seat’ on the other hand is specifically defined in

  Section 3 of the English Arbitration Act. Therefore, this would

  clearly indicate that the parties understood that the

  arbitration law of England would be applicable to the

  arbitration agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_164">

</p><p id="p_165">73.In view of the aforesaid, we are unable to uphold the

  conclusion arrived at by the Delhi High Court that the

  applicability of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_154">Arbitration Act</a>, 1996 to the arbitration

        be governed by the English law. Therefore, the

          lant that since substantive law governing the con-
