<p id="p_1">M.Y. EQBAL, J.:
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.   This appeal is directed against the judgment and order

dated 28.3.2005 passed by Calcutta High Court in S.A.
</p>
<p id="p_3">No.244 of 1987 whereby the judgment and decree passed by

the Trial Court as also the Appellate Court has been reversed

and the suit was dismissed holding that the suit itself was

barred by limitation and lack of relevant pleading and

evidence disentitle the plaintiff-appellant to get a decree for




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              1</span>
                                                          Page 1
specific performance and for re-conveyance of the suit

property.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.   The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.   The plaintiffs-appellants in need of money took a loan of

Rs.3,000/- from the defendants-respondents and executed a

registered Kobala dated 24.11.1964.     On the same day, a

registered Ekrarnama was also executed between the parties

stipulating the terms of re-conveyance on payment of the

loan amount by the appellants to the respondents.
</p>


<p id="p_6">4.   In the year 1970, the appellants filed a suit being Title

Suit No.215 of 1970 against the defendants before the Sub-
</p>
<p id="p_7">Divisional Munsif, Bangaon under Section 36 of the Bengal

Money Lenders Act, 1940. The said suit was resisted by the

defendants-respondents, stating therein that the aforesaid

sale deed executed by the plaintiffs was out an out-sale of

the suit property and possession was also delivered to the

respondents. The learned Munsif in terms of the judgment

dated 20.12.1973 dismissed the suit. The plaintiffs then filed




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              2</span>
                                                         Page 2
appeal against the said judgment being Title Appeal No.350

of 1974. The learned Additional District Judge, upon hearing

the parties, allowed the appeal and remanded the matter

back to the Trial Court with a direction to the Trial Court to

allow the plaintiffs-appellants an opportunity for amending

the plaint and to add prayer for specific performance of the

contract and to pass fresh judgment in accordance with law.
</p>


<p id="p_8">5.   Consequent upon the remand, the appellants amended

the plaint by filing application on 1.3.1975 adding prayer for

specific performance of contract to transfer the suit property

in terms of the agreement for re-conveyance.         The said

application for amendment was allowed and the learned

Munsif framed additional issues, and after considering the

evidence on record finally decreed the suit holding that the

suit was not barred by limitation. The court of Munsif held

that the order for amendment related back to the date of

institution of the suit and, therefore, the suit cannot be held

to be barred by limitation. Aggrieved by the said judgment




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              3</span>

and decree, the defendants-respondents filed appeal being

Title Appeal No.836 of 1983, which was dismissed on merit

by the First Appellate Court.            The respondents then filed

Second Appeal, which was finally allowed in favour of the

defendant-respondents and the judgment and decree passed

by both the courts of Munsif and the Additional District Judge

have been set aside. Hence, this appeal by special leave by

the plaintiff-appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.   From the impugned judgment passed by the High Court

it appears that the High Court formulated the following

substantial questions of law and considered the same while

allowing the appeal:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     “1)   Whether the Learned Courts below erred in law in
           granting a decree for specific performance of contract
           notwithstanding the fact that the necessary averment as
           required by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_1">Specific Relief Act</a>
           were absent in the plaint.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2)Whether from the materials on records both the
     learned Courts below ought to have held that the
     plaintiffs had failed to plead and prove that they
     were ready and willing to perform their part of
     contract.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     3)Whether the prayer for specific performance of
     contract in the instant case is barred by limitation.</blockquote>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     4</span>
<p id="p_10">                                                                     Page 4
</p><p id="p_11">     4)Whether the amendment as prayed for was rightly
     allowed and whether on the basis of the said
     amendment both the Courts below rightly decreed
     the suit.”



</p><p id="p_12">7.   Before we proceed with the matter, it would be proper

to first go through the judgment of remand passed by the

Additional District Judge in first round of appeal being Title

Appeal No.350 of 1974, which was preferred against the

judgment passed by Munsif dismissing the suit of the

plaintiffs-appellants.   From perusal of the judgment, it

reveals that both parties made their submission on the

interpretation of two documents, namely Kobala and the

agreement of re-conveyance. It also reveals that there were

exchange of letters (Exhibit ‘B’ and ‘B1’) whereupon the

defendants-respondents in the reply letter expressed their

willingness to reconvey the land but after harvest of

aushpaddy on the suit land. Thereafter, the plaintiff issued

another letter dated 6.6.1968 agreeing to have conveyance

of the suit land after harvest on payment of Rs.3000/-
</p>
<p id="p_13">(Exhibit ‘B2’).   The defendant also replied to such letter




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               5</span>
                                                         Page 5
(Exhibit ‘B3’) agreeing to reconvey the suit land after the

harvest.
</p>


<p id="p_14">8.   On the basis of these exchanges of letters and in the

facts and circumstances of the case, the Appellate Court held

that the plaintiff-appellants should be given opportunity to

have specific performance of contract in terms of the

agreement. The relevant portion of the finding and the order

passed in the appeal is extracted hereinbelow:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           “The learned advocate for the plaintiffs-
           appellants submits in view of the facts
           and circumstances the plaintiffs should
           be given an opportunity to have a
           specific   performance    of   contract   in
           terms of an agreement (ext.1).       Under
           the law time is not essence of contract in
           case of sale of land.          The parties
           mutually extended the time as the
           letters passed between them indicate.</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">           The evidence on record does not speak
           for the fact that the plaintiffs are keen to
           treat the transaction as a loan under the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                6</span>
                                                          Page 6
provision of Bengal Money Lenders Act.
They are, on the other hand, keen to fall
back upon the agreement of repurchase
Ext.1. But the suit has been framed as
one under section 36 of Bengal Money
Lenders Act and as such no relief can be
given to the plaintiffs by way of specific
performance. So far the end of justice
the   plaintiff   should         be      given    an
opportunity to include a prayer for
specific    performance          of    contract   by
effecting    amendment            of     the   plaint
appropriately and on payment of the
requisite court fees and on compliance
with the formalities of a suit for specific
performance.
</p><p id="p_16">      The    learned        advocate       for    the
respondents has objected to giving of
such opportunity to the plaintiffs as the
proposed     amendment            will    alter   the
nature of the suit. I do not think so.
The main prayer of the plaintiffs is for
restoration of the land in terms of the
agreement      either       by    reopening       the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                        7</span>
                                                        Page 7
transaction or by specific performance of
contract.
</p><p id="p_17">     Considering all these, I for the ends
of justice remand the suit for giving the
plaintiffs an opportunity to amend the
plaint in the light of observation made
above in my judgment.           The result the
appeal succeeds.           Memo of appeal is
correctly stamped. Hence,
                   ORDERED
that the appeal be allowed on contest
without costs. The judgment and decree
of the learned Munsif are hereby set
aside. The suit be remanded to the trial
court    for   allowing       the    plaintiff   an
opportunity to amend the plaint for
making         a     prayer         for   specific
performance of contract.             The plaintiff
shall pay a cost of Rs.30/- (Rupees
Thirty) to the defendants for making
such amendment. The defendants shall
get opportunity to file additional written
statement.         The amendment shall be
effected within two months from the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                       8</span>
                                                      Page 8
          receipt of record of this suit. In default,
          the plaintiffs’ suit shall stands dismissed.
          After the amendment the learned Munsif
          shall decide the suit on taking further
          evidence if the parties like to adduce
          and on the basis of evidence on record
          in terms of the added prayer of the
          plaintiffs.”



</p><p id="p_18">9.   From the finding recorded by the Additional District

Judge in the aforementioned judgment of remand, it is

evidently clear that a direction was issued to the learned

Munsif to allow the plaintiff to amend the plaint on payment

of cost of Rs.30/-. The Appellate Court also gave opportunity

to the defendants-respondents for filing additional written

statement.
</p>


<p id="p_19">10. In terms of the aforesaid judgment, the plaint was

amended and a relief for a decree of specific performance

was added in the said suit. The learned Munsif, after framing

additional issue and considering the facts and evidence on




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               9</span>
                                                         Page 9
record, decreed the suit for specific performance holding that

the suit was not barred by limitation.     While passing the

decree, the plaintiff-appellant was directed to deposit

consideration amount of Rs.3,000/-.
</p>


<p id="p_20">11. Learned Munsif held that after the amendment was

allowed and relief for decree of specific performance was

added, it should be deemed that the suit for specific

performance was filed on the date of institution of the suit

i.e. 7.5.1970.
</p>
<p id="p_21">12. Aggrieved by the said judgment and decree passed by

the Munsif, the defendants-respondents preferred an appeal

being Title Appeal No.836 of 1983.     The said appeal was

heard and finally dismissed by the First Appellate Court

holding that the suit was well within the period of limitation

and it was not barred by limitation inasmuch as the

amendment of the plaint related back to the date of the

presentation of the plaint.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              10</span>
<p id="p_22">                                                        Page 10
</p><p id="p_23">13. The     defendants-respondents          then       assailed    the

judgment by filing second appeal being S.A. No.244 of 1987.
</p>
<p id="p_24">The High Court, as stated above, reversed the finding given

by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court and set aside the

same by allowing the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_25">14. From perusal of the judgment passed by the High Court,

it reveals that the High Court, after referring <a href="/doc/1779540/" id="a_2">Section 16</a> and

<a href="/doc/1009821/" id="a_3">Section 20</a> of the Specific Relief Act and relying on the

decision of the Supreme Court, came to the conclusion that

since the readiness and willingness have not been averred

and proved, both the Trial Court and First Appellate Court

committed     error      in   decreeing   the   suit    for   specific

performance.     The High Court further observed that by

converting a suit under Section 36 of the Bengal Money

lenders Act into a suit for specific performance, basically the

nature and character of the suit was changed and such

amendments have been wrongly allowed in favour of the

plaintiffs-appellants.

         question of law, not formulated by it, if it is
         satisfied that the case involves such question.”

manifestly clear that an appeal shall lie to the High Court

from an appellate decree only if the High Court is satisfied

that the case involves a substantial question of law.          It

further mandates that the memorandum of appeal precisely

states the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_33">If such an appeal is filed, the High Court while admitting or

entertaining the appeal must record its satisfaction and

formulate the substantial question of law involved in the

appeal. The appeal shall then be heard on the questions so

only on those substantial questions of law. However, proviso

to this section empowers the court to hear on any substantial

question of law not formulated after recording reasons.

quoted hereinbelow:-

          hereinbefore prescribed, it may be rejected, or
          be returned to the appellant for the purpose of
          being amended within a time to be fixed by
          the Court or be amended then and there.

</p><p id="p_38">20. It is, therefore, clear that if a memorandum of appeal

arising out from an appellate decree is not drawn up in the

manner provided in the Code, the Court may reject the

memorandum of appeal or return the same for the purposes

of being amended within the time fixed by the Court.
</p>


<p id="p_39">21. In the instant case what the High Court has done is

evident from its order dated 13.1.1987. The order reads as

under:-

<p id="p_40">          “This appeal will be heard on all the grounds
          and issue a Rule and stay as prayed for”



</p><p id="p_41">22. The aforesaid order shows that the High Court while

admitting the appeal has not formulated any substantial

question of law and it was only after the arguments were

concluded some questions of law were formulated and the

appeal was decided by passing the impugned judgment.
</p>


<p id="p_42">23.   The law is well settled by catena of decisions of this

Court that jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a second

appeal is confined only to such appeals which involves

substantial question of law. Section 100 of the Code casts a

mandate on the High Court to first formulate substantial

question of law at the time of admission of the appeal. In

other words, a duty is cast on the High Court to formulate

substantial question of law before hearing the appeal. Since

the same has not been done, the impugned judgment is

vitiated in law.
</p>
<p id="p_43">24. On the question of readiness and willingness, the High

Court after relying upon some decisions of this Court allowed

the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the

Trial Court and the First Appellate Court.               The only finding

recorded by the High Court is extracted hereinbelow:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                   “In my view, both the Courts below totally

          Courts below also failed to consider that this readiness

          scanning the judgment and decree passed by the

committed error of law in setting aside the judgment and

decree of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court on the

basis of aforesaid finding.
</p>
<p id="p_45">26. It is well settled proposition of law that in a suit for

specific performance the plaintiff must be able to show that

he is ready and willing to carry out those obligations which

are in fact part of the consideration for the undertaking of

the defendant.     For the compliance of <a href="/doc/1058865/" id="a_4">Section 16(c)</a> of the

Act it is not necessary for the plaintiff to aver in the same

words used in the section i.e. ready and willing to perform

the contract.     Absence of the specific words in the plaint

would not result in dismissal of the suit if sufficient fact and

evidence are brought on record to satisfy the court the

readiness and willingness to perform his part of the contract.

<p id="p_46">In the case of Kedar Lal Seal &amp; Anr. vs. Hari Lal Seal, AIR

(39) 1952 SC 47, this Court has held that the Court would be

slow to throw out the claim on mere technicality of the

pleading. The Court observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">          “51. I would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere
          technicality of pleading when the substance of the
          thing is there and no prejudice is caused to the other
          side, however clumsily or inartistically the plaint may
          be worded. In any event, it is always open to a court
          to give a plaintiff such general or other relief as it
          deems just to the same extent as if it had been
          asked for, provided that occasions no prejudice to
          the other side beyond what can be compensated for
          in costs.”



</blockquote><p id="p_47">27. In the case of Syed Dastagir vs. T.R. Gopalakrishna

Setty, (1999) 6 SCC 337, this Court dealing with a similar

issue observed:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 18</span>
<p id="p_48">                                                                Page 18
“9. So the whole gamut of the issue raised is, how to
construe a plea specially with reference to <a href="/doc/1058865/" id="a_5">Section
16(c)</a> and what are the obligations which the plaintiff
has to comply with in reference to his plea and
whether the plea of the plaintiff could not be
construed to conform to the requirement of the
aforesaid section, or does this section require
specific words to be pleaded that he has performed
or has always been ready and is willing to perform
his part of the contract. In construing a plea in any
pleading, courts must keep in mind that a plea is not
an expression of art and science but an expression
through words to place fact and law of one’s case for
a relief. Such an expression may be pointed, precise,
sometimes vague but still it could be gathered what
he wants to convey through only by reading the
whole pleading, depending on the person drafting a
plea. In India most of the pleas are drafted by
counsel hence the aforesaid difference of pleas
which inevitably differ from one to the other. Thus,
to gather true spirit behind a plea it should be read
as a whole. This does not distract one from
performing his obligations as required under a
statute. But to test whether he has performed his
obligations, one has to see the pith and substance of
a plea. Where a statute requires any fact to be
pleaded then that has to be pleaded maybe in any
form. The same plea may be stated by different
persons through different words; then how could it
be constricted to be only in any particular
nomenclature or word. Unless a statute specifically
requires a plea to be in any particular form, it can be
in any form. No specific phraseology or language is
required to take such a plea. The language in
<a href="/doc/1058865/" id="a_6">Section 16(c)</a> does not require any specific
phraseology but only that the plaintiff must aver
that he has performed or has always been and is
willing to perform his part of the contract. So the
compliance of “readiness and willingness” has to be
in spirit and substance and not in letter and form. So
to insist for a mechanical production of the exact
words of a statute is to insist for the form rather
than the essence. So the absence of form cannot
dissolve an essence if already pleaded.”

Anr., AIR 2006 SC 2172, this Court observed that

         “17. It is not within the domain of the High
         Court to investigate the grounds on which the
         findings were arrived at, by the last court of
         fact. It is true that the lower appellate court
         should not ordinarily reject witness accepted
         by the trial court in respect of credibility but
         even where it has rejected the witnesses
         accepted by the trial court, the same is no
         ground for interference in second appeal,
         when it is found that the appellate court has
         given satisfactory reasons for doing so. In a
         case where from a given set of circumstances
         two inferences are possible. One drawn by the
         lower appellate court is binding on the High
         Court in second appeal. Adopting any other
         approach is not permissible. The High Court
         cannot substitute its opinion for the opinion of
         the first appellate court unless it is found that
         the conclusions drawn by the lower appellate
         court were erroneous being contrary to the
         mandatory provisions of law applicable or its
         settled     position    on    the      basis   of
         pronouncements made by the Apex Court, or
         was based upon inadmissible evidence or
         arrived at without evidence.

         a larger Bench of the High Court concerned or
         by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or
         by the Supreme Court, its merely wrong
         application on the facts of the case would not
         be termed to be a substantial question of law.
         Where a point of law has not been pleaded or
         is found to be arising between the parties in
         the absence of any factual format, a litigant
         should not be allowed to raise that question as

          documentary evidence or the meaning of
          entries and the contents of the document
          cannot be held to be raising a substantial
          question of law. But where it is found that the
          first appellate court has assumed jurisdiction
          which did not vest in it, the same can be
          adjudicated in the second appeal, treating it as
          a substantial question of law. Where the first
          appellate court is shown to have exercised its
          discretion in a judicial manner, it cannot be
          termed to be an error either of law or of
          procedure requiring interference in second
          appeal. This Court in <a href="/doc/1704036/" id="a_7">Reserve Bank of
          India vs. Ramkrishna Govind Morey</a>, AIR 1976
          SC 830, held that whether the trial court
          should not have exercised its jurisdiction
          differently is not a question of law justifying
          interference.”

          discharged from his obligations. No further
          performance by him was either contemplated
          or had to be tendered. In a suit for specific
          performance, on the other hand, he treated
          and was required by the Court to treat the
          contract as still subsisting. He had in that suit
          to allege, and if the fact was traversed, he was
          required to prove a continuous readiness and

         that this is the invariable practice of pleading,
         and if we may say so, a desirable practice, de-
         signed to give a clear and express notice to
         the opponent of the case sought to be made

         which would render the structure of the suit
         itself defective or that without it a proper
         cause of action would not appear on the plaint.

          were disposed and able to complete it if it had
          not been renounced by the defendants. What
          more can reasonably be required by the
          parties for whom the goods are to be
          manufactured? If, having accepted a part, they
          are unable to pay for the residue, and have
          resolved not to accept them, no benefit can
          accrue to them from a useless waste of
