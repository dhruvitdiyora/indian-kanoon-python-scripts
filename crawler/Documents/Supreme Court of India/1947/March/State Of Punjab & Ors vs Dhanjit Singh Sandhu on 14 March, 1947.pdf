State of Punjab and Others                   …….Appellants

                                   Versus

Dhanjit Singh Sandhu                         …..Respondent


                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">M.Y. EQBAL, J.:
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.    These appeals are  directed  against  the  judgment  and  order  dated
8.1.2009 passed by the Punjab &amp; Haryana High  Court  in  C.W.P.  No.8864  of
2007 and also order dated  27.3.2009 passed in Review Petition  No.  112  of
2009, whereby the writ petition filed by the  respondent  was   allowed  and
the  order  dated   23.12.2004  passed  by  appellant  no.3  rejecting   the
application for refund of the extension fee received  by  the  appellant  in
excess of the rates mentioned in Rule 13 of the  Punjab  Regional  and  Town
Planning and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_1">Development Act</a>, 1995 (in short ‘1995 Act’)  in  the  light  of
the judgment passed in C.W.P. No.13648 of 1998 (Tehal  Singh  vs.  State  of
Punjab &amp; Ors.) along with up-to-date  interest has been set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    The respondent was allotted  a  plot  of  land  measuring  400  square
yards bearing No.2177 at Durgi Road, Urban Estate  Phase-II,  Ludhiana  vide
allotment letter dated 1.4.1986.  In terms of allotment, the respondent  was
required to complete the construction of building within  three  years  from
the date of issuance of the allotment letter after getting the plans of  the
proposed building approved by the  competent  Authority.  The  case  of  the
respondent-writ petitioner is that there was no condition in  the  allotment
letter for charging extension  fee  in  the  case  of  failure  to  complete
construction of the building  within  the  aforementioned  period  of  three
years nevertheless as per clause 15 of the allotment letter,  the  allotment
was subject to the provisions of Punjab Estates (Development and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation
Act</a>), 1964 and the Rules and Policies framed thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    It appears that in the year 1995, the State of Punjab  came  with  the
legislation known as Punjab Regional and Town Planning and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_3">Development  Act</a>,
1995 (in short ‘PUDA Act’).   By the  said  Act,  the  Punjab  Urban  Estate
(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Regulation) Act</a> 1964  (in  short  ‘1964  Act’)  and  Punjab
Housing Development Board Act, 1972 were repealed.   In  exercise  of  power
conferred under the Act,  the  State  Government  framed  rules  called  the
Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development (General) Rules  1995  (in
short ‘1995  Rules’)  which  was  published  vide  Notification  dated  22nd
August, 1995.  Rule 13 of the Rules specified  the  time  within  which  the
building is to be constructed.  It  also  provides  for  extension  of  time
limit subject to payment of prescribed fee mentioned therein.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.     The  Punjab  Urban  Planning  and  Development  Authority  (in  short
‘PUDA’) issued a circular dated 15.1.1998 revising  the  rate  of  extension
fee chargeable for the residential and commercial  plots  and  by  the  said
circular a very high rate of extension fee was proposed to be  charged.  The
respondent from time to time deposited the extension fee so demanded by  the
appellant.  It is alleged that an amount of Rs.1.20 lacs has been in  excess
charged from the respondent.   The appellant’s case is  that  the  appellant
in an attempt to nullify the  effect  of  the  judgment  rendered  in  Tehal
Singh’s case and to validate the demand of enhanced rate  of  extension  fee
purportedly framed the Rules called Punjab Regional and  Town  Planning  and
Development  (General) Second Amendment Rules, 2001 (in short ‘2001  Rules’)
giving retrospective effect.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    The respondent moved a writ petition being C.W.P.  No.  7934  of  2004
praying inter alia for the directions to refund the excess fee charged  from
the respondent.  It was disposed of with the directions to the appellant  to
reconsider the representation and to dispose of the same  in  the  light  of
the order passed in C.W.P.  No.13648  of  1998  (Tehal  Singh’s  case).   In
compliance with the aforesaid directions,  the  respondent’s  representation
was considered and came to be rejected by the  appellant  vide  order  dated
23.12.2004 on the ground that in the facts and  circumstances  of  the  case
the instant case was not similar to Tehal Singh’s case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   The writ petition was finally heard by  the  Punjab  and  Haryana  High
Court and relying  on  the  ratio  decided  in  Tehal  Sing’s  case  (supra)
disposed  of  the  writ  petition,  quashed  the  notice  and  directed  the
appellant to calculate the extension fee as per Rule 13 of 1995 Rules.   For
better appreciation, the concluding paragraphs 15  to  17  of  the  impugned
order are quoted hereinbelow:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           “15. When the facts of the present  case  are  examined  in  the
           light of the  principle laid down by the Division Bench judgment
           in Tehal Singh’s  case (supra), we are left with no  doubt  that
           the  show  cause  notices  issued   to    the    petitioner   on
           19.9.2006  (P-4)  and   12.12.2006 {P-7} requiring  him  to  pay
           extension fee of Rs. 1,32,958/- was violative of the  provisions
           of the 1995 Act and Rule 13 of the 1995 Rules,  as  has  already
           been noticed in the preceding paras. The controversy,  in  fact,
           stand settled by the Division Bench judgment  in  Tehal  Singh's
           case (supra) and the issue does not deserve to be reopened.  The
           respondents have failed to  consider  the  reply  filed  by  the
           petitioner wherein judgment rendered by the  Division  Bench  in
           Tehal Singh's case (supra) has been cited and  the  charging  of
           extension fee at exorbitant rate has been duly answered.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           16. In view of above, the writ petition succeeds.  The  impugned
           notice dated 12.12.2006 (P-7) is hereby quashed. The respondents
           are directed to calculate the extension fee as per  Rule  13  of
           the 1995 Rules. The needful shall be done within a period of two
           months from the date of receipt of  a  certified  copy  of  this
           order. The petitioner shall  pay  the  extension  fee  within  a
           period of two months from the date of receipt of the calculation
           given in the fresh notice to be issued by the  respondents.  The
           petitioner shall further be entitled to consequential benefit to
           get the  site  plans  approved.  The  petitioner  is  also  held
           entitled to his costs.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           17. The other connected writ petitions are also disposed  of  in
           the above terms. It is, however, clarified that in cases such as
           C.W.P. Nos. 8864 and 13765 of 2007, where the  petitioners  have
           already paid the extension fee as per the rates demanded by  the
           respondents, which are exorbitant and against the Division Bench
           judgment of this Court in Tehal Singh's  case,  the  respondents
           are directed to re-calculate the amount of extension fee as  per
           the provisions of Rule 13 of the  Rules  and  refund  the  over-
           payment alongwith interest 10% per annum.”

</blockquote><p id="p_9">8.    We have heard Mrs. Rachna Joshi Issar, learned counsel  appearing  for
the appellant.

<p id="p_10">9.      As  noticed  above,  the  plot  in  question  was  allotted  to  the
respondent vide an  allotment  letter  dated  1.4.1986.   In  terms  of  the
allotment letter, the allottee had  to  fulfill  the  terms  and  conditions

</blockquote><p id="p_11">10.  Further, it is clear that the allotment of the plot was subject to  the
provisions contained in the 1964 Act.   <a href="/doc/1306713/" id="a_6">Section  10</a>  of  the  Act  envisages
provision for resumption and forfeiture of the land in  case  of  breach  of
conditions of allotment.  <a href="/doc/1306713/" id="a_7">Section 10</a> reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">           “10. Resumption   and   forfeiture for breach of  conditions  of
           transfer.-  (i)  If  any  transferee  has  failed  to  pay   the

           <a href="/doc/1965985/" id="a_8">section 3</a>, or has committed a breach of any other  condition  of

           respect of the sale of the site or building, or both) should not
           be made".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">11.   In exercise of power conferred by 1964 Act, Rules were framed  in  the
year 1965 i.e. Punjab  Urban  Estate  (Development  and  Regulation)  Rules,
1964.  Rule 14 of the said Rules categorically provided that the  transferee
shall complete the building within three years from the  date  of  issue  of
the allotment letter.  In accordance  with  the  Rules  and  Regulations  of
erection of  the building, the time limit may  be  extended  by  the  Estate
Officer if he is satisfied that failure to complete the construction of  the
building within the said period was due to the reasons  beyond  the  control
of the allottee.
</p><p id="p_13">12.   Since the  respondent-allottee  failed  to  abide  by  the  terms  and
conditions and did not  raise  construction,  he  was  liable  to  pay  non-
construction fee/extension fee which was  demanded  from  him  in  order  to
enable him to avoid resumption of the plot to the appellant-authority.   The
aforesaid demand was made by letters dated  6.1.1997  and  27.10.1999.   The
said letter dated 6.1.1997 is extracted hereinbelow:-

</blockquote><p id="p_14">13.  In response to the aforesaid  letter  dated  6.1.1997,  the  respondent
agreed to pay the extension  fee  imposed  by  the  Estate  Officer  of  the
appellant authority in order to avoid resumption/auction of the plot.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.   Meanwhile, the State  of  Punjab  enacted  Punjab  Regional  and  Town
Planning and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_10">Development Act</a>, 1995.   Rules were also framed under the  said
Act.  By <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_11">Section 183</a> of 1995 Act, earlier Act of  1964  and  Punjab  Housing
Development Board Act, 1972 were repealed with the saving clause.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.   Subsequent to the aforesaid  Act,  by  Notification  dated  30.6.1995,
Punjab Urban Development Authority was established w.e.f. 1.7.1995  and  the
Board stood abolished with effect from that  date.   Many  other  Acts  were
also repealed.  By the said Act Authority was empowered  to  deal  with  the
land and prescribe the fee in case where extension of period for  completion
of building is set for by the allottee.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.   Since the High Court passed the impugned order following the  decision
rendered by the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in Tehal Singh’s case, it  would
be proper to refer the facts of that case.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.  In Tehal Singh vs. State of Punjab and Ors. (C.W.P. No.13648 of  1998),
the petitioner filed the writ petition seeking a writ for  quashing  certain
letters demanding  extension  fee  and  striking  down  condition  No.19  of
allotment letter,  insofar  as  it  relates  to  the  charging  of  separate
extension fee for  non  completion  of  construction  of  building.  Further
mandamus was sought for directing the respondents to  charge  extension  fee
from the petitioner under the provisions of Rule 13 of 1995 Rules. The  High
Court after referring  various  provisions  of  1995  Acts  and  Rules  made
thereunder observed as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">           “A conjoint reading of the various provisions of  the  1995  Act
           and the 1995 Rules shows that the transfer of  land  under  sub-
           section (1) of <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_12">Section 43</a> is not only subject to the  directions
           which may be given by the State Government under  the  1995  Act
           but also the conditions which may be prescribed with  regard  to
           completion of building  of  part  thereof  and  with  regard  to
           extension of period for such completion and payment of  fee  for
           such extension. A perusal of rule 13 of  the  1995  Rules  along
           with <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_13">Section 180</a> (2) (i) and <a href="/doc/1647575/" id="a_14">Section 2</a>  (zc)  of  the  1995  Act
           shows that the time within which the building is to be completed
           and other related  matters  are  governed  by  the  1995  Rules.
           Therefore, with the coming into force of these Rules, the  rates
           of extension fee prescribed by the Board stood superseded and in
           terms of sub-rule  (2)  of  Rule  13  of  the  1995  Rules,  the
           petitioners became eligible to seek extension of  the  specified
           time limit subject to payment of the fee prescribed  under  sub-
           rule (3) of Rule 13.”

</blockquote><p id="p_19">18.    The Court further came to the following conclusions:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">           “We have thoughtfully considered the respective submissions.  In
           our  opinion,  Shri  Malhotra’s  contention  on  the  issue   of
           applicability of the 1995 Act  to  the  plots  allotted  to  the
           petitioners is clearly wide of the margin. A bare reading of the
           plain language of sub-section (4)of <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_15">Section 183</a> of the 1995  Act
           makes it clear that the allotment of <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_16">Section 183</a> of the 1995 Act
           makes it clear that the allotment made by  the  erstwhile  Board
           will be deemed to have been made under the 1995 Act.  Therefore,
           the construction of the building will have to  be  regulated  by
           the conditions of allotment read with Rule 13 of the 1995 Rules.
           As  a  logical  corollary,  the  extension  of  the  time  limit
           specified in the letter of allotment will also  be  governed  by
           the provisions  of  the  1995  Rules  and  the  petitioners  are
           entitled to seek extension of the time limit by paying  the  fee
           prescribed under Rule 13”.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_20">19.    Consequently  the  Court  declared  the  notices  demanding  enhanced
extension fee as illegal and ultra vires  to  the  provisions  of  1995  Act
under the Rules made thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.   It is worth to mention here that the aforesaid  judgment  rendered  in
Tehal Singh’s case  was  challenged  before  the  Supreme  Court  in  S.L.P.
No.18500-18501 of 1999 and was dismissed on 10.11.2000, but the  said  order
of dismissal was modified by the Supreme Court by order dated  12.2.2001  in
the following terms.
</p><p id="p_22">           “In the facts and circumstances of the case the order  does  not
           warrant in any interference of  this  Court.   The  appeals  are
           accordingly dismissed.”




</p><p id="p_23">21.   As noticed above, the facts are quite  different  from  the  facts  in
Tehal  Singh’s  case.   In  the  instant  case,  the   respondents-allottees
accepted the terms and conditions of the  allotment  letter  and  possession
were taken but they did not raise any construction upto 2000.  There  was  a
specific condition that non-construction  of  building  would  lead  to  the
resumption of the said plot under the provisions of the Acts and the  Rules.
 As noticed above, when the allottees did  not  raise  construction  on  the
plot, the demand was raised for payment  of  non-construction  fee/extension
fee in order to avoid resumption of the  plot  by  the  Authority,  allottee
paid the extension fee.  After availing the benefit of extension on  payment
of extension  fee,  the  allottee  sent  a  letter  to  the  Estate  Officer
demanding refund of the extension fee on the basis of  amended  Rule  13  of
1995 Rules.  The said demand was rejected by the Estate Officer  by  passing
the reasoned order in compliance of the directions of the  High  Court.   In
the facts of the instant case, we have no doubt in our mind in holding  that
the ratio decided in Tehal Singh’s case will not apply in the instant  case.
 In our considered opinion defaulting allottes of valuable plots  cannot  be
allowed to approbate and reprobate by first agreeing to abide by  terms  and
conditions of allotment and later seeking to deny  their  liability  as  per
the agreed terms.
</p>
<p id="p_24">22. The  doctrine  of  “approbate  and  reprobate”  is  only  a  species  of
estoppel, it implies only to the conduct of  parties.  As  in  the  case  of
estoppel it cannot operate  against  the  provisions  of  a  statute.  (vide
<a href="/doc/497554/" id="a_17">C.I.T. vs. Mr. P. Firm Maur</a>, AIR 1965 SC 1216).
</p><p id="p_25">      It is settled proposition of law that once an order has  been  passed,
it is complied with, accepted by the other party  and  derived  the  benefit
out of it, he cannot challenge it on any  ground.  (Vide  Maharashtra  State
Road Transport Corporation vs. Balwant Regular  Motor  Service,  Amravati  &amp;
Ors., AIR 1969 SC 329). In R.N. Gosain vs. Yashpal Dhir, AIR  1993  SC  352,
this Court has observed as under:–
            “Law does not permit a person to both approbate and  reprobate.
           This principle is  based  on  the  doctrine  of  election  which
           postulates  that  no  party  can  accept  and  reject  the  same
           instrument and that “a person cannot say  at  one  time  that  a
           transaction is valid and thereby obtain some advantage, to which
           he could only be entitled on the footing that it is  valid,  and
           then turn round and say it is void for the purpose  of  securing
           some other advantage.”


</p><p id="p_26">23.    This Court in Sri Babu Ram Alias  Durga  Prasad  vs.  Sri  Indra  Pal
Singh (Dead) by Lrs., AIR 1998  SC  3021,  and  P.R.  Deshpande  vs.  Maruti
Balram Haibatti, AIR 1998 SC 2979, the Supreme Court has observed  that  the
doctrine of election is based on the rule of estoppel-  the  principle  that
one cannot approbate and reprobate inheres in it. The doctrine  of  estoppel
by election is  one of the   species  of  estoppel  in  pais  (or  equitable
estoppel), which is a  rule  in  equity.  By  that  law,  a  person  may  be
precluded by his actions or conduct or  silence  when  it  is  his  duty  to
speak, from asserting a right which he otherwise would have had.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24. The Supreme Court in The  Rajasthan  State  Industrial  Development  and
Investment Corporation and Anr. vs. Diamond and Gem Development  Corporation
Ltd. and Anr., AIR 2013 SC 1241, made an observation that a party cannot  be
permitted to “blow hot  and  cold”,  “fast  and  loose”  or  “approbate  and
reprobate”.  Where one knowingly accepts  the  benefits  of  a  contract  or
conveyance or an order, is estopped to deny the validity or  binding  effect
on him of such contract or conveyance or order. This rule is applied  to  do
equity, however, it must not be applied  in  a  manner  as  to  violate  the
principles of right and good conscience.
</p>

<p id="p_28">25. It is evident that the doctrine of election is  based  on  the  rule  of
estoppel the principle that one cannot approbate and reprobate  is  inherent
in it. The doctrine of estoppel by election is  one  among  the  species  of
estoppel in pais (or equitable estoppel), which is  a  rule  of  equity.  By
this law, a person may be precluded, by way of his actions, or  conduct,  or
silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he  would
have otherwise had.
</p>
<p id="p_29">26.   Be that as it may, so far as the instant case is concerned,  the  High
Court has totally overlooked the facts of the present case and  allowed  the
writ petition.  The impugned order, therefore, cannot be  sustained  in  law
and is hereby set aside.  The appeals are accordingly allowed.  However,  in
the facts of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
